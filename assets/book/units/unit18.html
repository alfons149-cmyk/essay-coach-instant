    <h1>Writing for Impact — Developing a Personal Academic Voice</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      When you read a strong essay, you can feel the writer behind it. The grammar is correct, yes —
      but there is something more. The sentences sound confident. The ideas feel connected. The tone
      is calm, but persuasive.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      That is the writer’s voice — the quiet power that gives writing its impact.
      In this unit, you will explore what an <strong>academic voice</strong> is, how to develop it,
      and how to make your writing stand out in the Cambridge C1 exam for the right reasons.

      <h2>1. What Is an Academic Voice?</h2>

      <p>
        An academic voice is not a style you copy — it is how <em>you</em> sound when you express your ideas
        clearly, logically, and respectfully in formal English.
      </p>

      <p><strong>It has three main qualities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — your message is easy to follow.</li>
        <li><strong>Authority</strong> — your tone feels confident and reasoned.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance</strong> — your attitude is fair and professional, not emotional.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your voice should communicate: “I understand this topic. I have thought about it carefully. And here is my view.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This matters far more than memorised expressions or complicated vocabulary.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-why-voice">
      <h2>2. Why Voice Matters in the C1 Essay</h2>

      <p>
        At lower levels, examiners focus on grammar and structure.
        At C1, they already expect those — what they want to see is <strong>ownership</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>A clear academic voice shows that you are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>not just copying templates,</li>
        <li>not afraid to express your ideas,</li>
        <li>and confident enough to think critically in English.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Grammar shows knowledge. Voice shows understanding.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-components">
      <h2>3. The Components of a Strong Academic Voice</h2>

      <p>To develop a confident voice, you need five main ingredients:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong> — knowing why you are writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone</strong> — keeping your language calm and objective.</li>
        <li><strong>Perspective</strong> — thinking independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision</strong> — choosing exact words.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence</strong> — writing with quiet confidence.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-purpose">
      <h2>4. Purpose: Writing with Intention</h2>

      <p>Every essay has a purpose: to argue, explain, or evaluate.</p>

      <p><strong>Example question:</strong></p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          “Some people say the best way to learn is through experience. Others prefer academic study.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to compare both methods and evaluate which is more effective.</p>

      <p>Ask yourself before writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the main question I am answering?</li>
        <li>What do I want the examiner to understand at the end?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-tone">
      <h2>5. Tone: Calm and Objective</h2>

      <p>
        A strong academic voice convinces through <strong>logic</strong>, not emotion. Avoid:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Exaggeration</em>: always, never, totally</li>
        <li><em>Emotional adjectives</em>: amazing, terrible, ridiculous</li>
        <li><em>Commands</em>: people must…, we should stop immediately</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Use mature tone markers instead:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>It could be argued that…</li>
        <li>This issue raises questions about…</li>
        <li>There is growing evidence that…</li>
        <li>One might reasonably suggest that…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These phrases add strength, not weakness. They sound thoughtful and fair.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-perspective">
      <h2>6. Perspective: Thinking Independently</h2>

      <p>Independent thinking means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>building on both opinions in the input texts,</li>
        <li>adding one original idea or example,</li>
        <li>and reaching a balanced conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Basic:</strong><br>
          Some people think technology helps us. Others think it harms us.
        </p>

        <p><strong>C1 voice:</strong><br>
          While technology has undoubtedly made life more convenient, its psychological and social
          impact is less positive. The key question is not whether it helps or harms, but how people
          choose to use it.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-precision">
      <h2>7. Precision: Choosing the Right Words</h2>

      <p>Your writing gains authority when your words express precisely what you mean.</p>

      <p><strong>Quick precision upgrades:</strong></p>

      <table class="table-2col">
        <tr><td>good / bad</td><td>beneficial / harmful</td></tr>
        <tr><td>big / small</td><td>major / minor</td></tr>
        <tr><td>a lot of</td><td>many / numerous</td></tr>
        <tr><td>thing</td><td>aspect / factor / issue</td></tr>
        <tr><td>say / tell</td><td>state / argue / claim</td></tr>
        <tr><td>show</td><td>demonstrate / indicate / reveal</td></tr>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-presence">
      <h2>8. Presence: Writing with Quiet Confidence</h2>

      <p>Presence does not mean writing “I think” repeatedly. It means sounding like someone who thinks.</p>

      <p>You achieve presence by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>using balanced clauses (<em>although, whereas, while</em>),</li>
        <li>using reasoning phrases (<em>this suggests that, this means that</em>),</li>
        <li>using short, decisive sentences at key moments.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>B2 level:</strong> I think people should do exercise because it is good for health.</p>
        <p><strong>C1 voice:</strong> Regular exercise improves health and concentration. It also reduces stress.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-killers">
      <h2>9. Avoiding Common Voice Killers</h2>

      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Overusing templates<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Vary your openings and be direct.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Over-formality<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Use natural academic phrasing.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Over-personalisation<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Use neutral markers (“In my view…”, “It could be argued that…”) sparingly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-flow">
      <h2>10. How to Create “Voice Flow”</h2>

      <p>Voice flow is the smooth, logical rhythm of ideas from start to finish.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduce calmly:</strong><br>
          Many people believe that education should focus on exams.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Develop fairly:</strong><br>
          Exams provide clear assessment, but they may also discourage creativity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Evaluate thoughtfully:</strong><br>
          A combination of exams and project-based learning may therefore produce better results.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-style-markers">
      <h2>11. Style Markers of a Mature Writer</h2>

      <p>Examiners recognise strong writing “by ear”. Here are the markers:</p>

      <table class="table-2col">
        <tr><td>repetitive phrases</td><td>varied, flexible openings</td></tr>
        <tr><td>mechanical sentences</td><td>controlled mix of long and short</td></tr>
        <tr><td>emotional tone</td><td>balanced reasoning</td></tr>
        <tr><td>simple listing</td><td>balanced clauses (although, whereas)</td></tr>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-authority">
      <h2>12. Writing with Authority (Without Arrogance)</h2>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Without authority:</strong><br>
          Maybe exams are good, but they can be stressful, so I am not sure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>With authority:</strong><br>
          Exams remain a useful method of evaluation, but they must be balanced with other forms of
          assessment to measure creativity and understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-rhythm">
      <h2>13. Developing Voice Through Word Rhythm</h2>

      <p>Rhythm makes writing memorable. Parallel structure is especially powerful.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>Education shapes not only what people know, but also how they think.</p>
        <p>Success requires effort, but also reflection.</p>
        <p>Technology connects us — and sometimes, it controls us.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-building-confidence">
      <h2>14. Building Confidence in Your Voice</h2>

      <p>Voice grows through reflection, rewriting, and awareness.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Rewrite a paragraph in your own words.</li>
        <li>Read your essay aloud.</li>
        <li>Remove memorised phrases.</li>
        <li>Write a short reflection after each essay.</li>

      <h2>15. The Golden Rule of Academic Voice</h2>

      <p><strong>Write to express, not to impress.</strong></p>

      <p>
        Forced formality feels fake.  
        Honest, precise writing feels powerful.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-transformation">
      <h2>16. Example: Voice Transformation</h2>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Before (B2 style):</strong><br>
          I think people should recycle more because it is important for the planet. Governments should also
          make people do it because not everyone cares.
        </p>

        <p><strong>After (C1 voice):</strong><br>
          Recycling is essential for protecting the environment and ensuring a sustainable future. However,
          voluntary efforts alone are rarely enough; government policies and public education are needed to
          create long-term change.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-final">
      <h2>17. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Your academic voice is not something you <em>learn once</em> — it is something you <em>build</em>.
      </p>

      <p>You develop it every time you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>choose precision over decoration,</li>
        <li>explain instead of exaggerate,</li>
        <li>and write with thought instead of fear.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At this stage, you are not just learning English — you are <strong>using English to think, argue, and
        connect</strong>. That is the essence of advanced writing.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Grammar makes you correct. Structure makes you clear. Voice makes you memorable.</strong></p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, you will move beyond the C1 structure and learn to write with the flexibility
        and intellectual confidence required for Cambridge Proficiency (C2).
