      When you read a strong essay, you can feel the writer behind it. The grammar is correct, yes –
      but there is something more. The sentences sound confident. The ideas feel connected.
      The tone is calm, but persuasive.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      That is the writer’s <strong>voice</strong> – the quiet power that gives writing its impact.

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, you will explore what an <strong>academic voice</strong> is, how to find it,
      and how to make your writing stand out in the Cambridge C1 exam for the right reasons.

      <h2>1. What Is an Academic Voice?</h2>

      <p>
        An academic voice is not a style you copy – it is how <strong>you</strong> sound when you
        express your ideas clearly, logically, and respectfully in formal English.
      </p>

      <p>It has three main qualities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – your message is easy to follow.</li>
        <li><strong>Authority</strong> – your tone feels confident and reasoned.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance</strong> – your attitude is fair and professional, not emotional.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your voice should say:
        <em>“I understand this topic. I have thought about it carefully. And here is my view.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        That impresses examiners far more than fancy vocabulary or memorised phrases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Why voice matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-why-voice">
      <h2>2. Why Voice Matters in the C1 Essay</h2>

      <p>
        At lower levels, teachers look for correct grammar and clear structure.
        At an advanced level, examiners already expect those things – what they want to see
        is <strong>ownership</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        They can immediately tell when a student has written with control and intention.
        A clear academic voice shows that you are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>not just copying formulae,</li>
        <li>not afraid to express your ideas,</li>
        <li>confident enough to think critically in English.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Remember:
        <strong>Grammar</strong> shows knowledge.
        <strong>Voice</strong> shows understanding.
      </p>

    <!-- 3. Components -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-components">
      <h2>3. The Components of a Strong Academic Voice</h2>

      <p>
        To develop a confident writing voice, you need five main ingredients:
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong> – knowing why you are writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone</strong> – keeping your language calm and objective.</li>
        <li><strong>Perspective</strong> – showing independent, thoughtful reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision</strong> – choosing words that express exactly what you mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence</strong> – writing with quiet confidence, not arrogance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let us explore each one.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Purpose -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-purpose">
      <h2>4. Purpose: Writing with Intention</h2>

      <p>
        Every essay has a purpose – to argue, explain, or evaluate.
        Before you write, decide precisely what yours is.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>“Some people say the best way to learn is through experience.
          Others prefer academic study.”</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Possible purpose:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>To compare both methods and explain which you consider more effective.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        When you know your purpose, you write more deliberately.
        Your sentences connect, your examples fit, and your reader can follow your reasoning.
      </p>

      <p>Ask yourself before writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the main question I am answering?</li>
        <li>What do I want the examiner to understand at the end?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your academic voice begins where your intention becomes clear.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Tone -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-tone">
      <h2>5. Tone: Calm and Objective</h2>

      <p>
        A strong academic voice never shouts. It convinces through calm logic, not emotion.
      </p>

      <p>Avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Exaggeration</strong> – <em>always, never, totally, completely</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emotional adjectives</strong> – <em>amazing, terrible, ridiculous</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct commands</strong> – <em>we must, people should stop immediately</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instead, use tone markers of maturity:</p>

      <ul class="example-list">
        <li><em>It could be argued that…</em></li>
        <li><em>This issue raises questions about…</em></li>
        <li><em>There is growing evidence that…</em></li>
        <li><em>One might reasonably suggest that…</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These phrases do not weaken your argument – they strengthen it.
        They make your voice sound thoughtful and fair.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Perspective -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-perspective">
      <h2>6. Perspective: Thinking Independently</h2>

      <p>
        Your essay should not sound like a collection of textbook ideas.
        It should sound like <strong>your own reasoning</strong> – expressed clearly.
      </p>

      <p>Independent thinking at C1 means you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>build on both given opinions, not just repeat them,</li>
        <li>add one original idea or example,</li>
        <li>reach a balanced conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example – Basic vs C1 Voice</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Basic:</strong><br>
          <em>Some people think technology helps us. Others think it harms us.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>C1 voice:</strong><br>
          <em>
            While technology has undoubtedly made life more convenient, its psychological and social
            impact is less positive. The key question is not whether technology helps or harms, but
            how people choose to use it.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second version thinks one step deeper – and that is exactly what C1 examiners reward.
        </p>

    </section>

    <!-- 7. Precision -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-precision">
      <h2>7. Precision: Choosing the Right Words</h2>

      <p>
        Your voice gains strength when your words fit perfectly.
        Precision shows care – that you know what you mean and you can express it exactly.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Small changes, big impact</h3>

          </tr>

      <p>
        Each refined choice adds to the impression that you own your words.

    <!-- 8. Presence -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-presence">
      <h2>8. Presence: Writing with Quiet Confidence</h2>

      <p>
        Presence does not mean writing <em>“I think”</em> in every paragraph.
        It means your essay sounds like it was written by someone who thinks.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>use balanced opinions: <em>although, while, to some extent</em>,</li>
        <li>use reasoning phrases: <em>this suggests that…, this means that…</em>,</li>
        <li>use short, conclusive sentences at key moments.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u18-ithink">
        <h3>Move beyond “I think”</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>B2 level:</strong><br>
          <em>I think people should do exercise because it is good for health.</em>
        </p>

          <em>
            Regular exercise improves health and concentration. It also reduces stress.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second version sounds confident and factual – you do not need to write
          <em>“I think”</em>. Your tone already communicates your view.

        Voice is not about being different – it is about being genuine.

      <h2>15. The Golden Rule of Academic Voice</h2>

      <p class="example">
        If one sentence defines this unit, it is this:<br>
        <strong>Write to express, not to impress.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        At an advanced level, readers can feel the difference.
        Forced formality feels fake.
        Honest, precise writing feels powerful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your best writing will always sound simple, clear, and deeply considered.

      <h2>16. Example: Voice Transformation</h2>

      <p>
        Here is a short example of how a paragraph changes when rewritten with a stronger academic voice.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Before (B2 style)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          I think people should recycle more because it is important for the planet and the future.
          Governments should also make people do it because not everyone cares about the environment.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>After (C1 academic voice)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Recycling is essential for protecting the environment and ensuring a sustainable future.
          However, voluntary efforts alone are rarely enough; government policies and public education
          are also needed to create long-term change.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Notice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>no <em>“I think”</em>,</li>
        <li>no emotional tone,</li>
        <li>balanced reasoning,</li>
        <li>clear purpose.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is confident, mature, and perfectly suited for the Cambridge C1 exam.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 17. Final reflection -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u18-final">
      <h2>17. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Your academic voice is not something you <em>learn</em> once – it is something you
        <strong>build</strong> every time you write.
      </p>

      <p>
        You build it every time you:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>choose precision over decoration,</li>
        <li>explain instead of exaggerate,</li>
        <li>write with thought instead of fear.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At this stage, you are not just learning English. You are using English to think, argue,
        and connect with readers. That is the essence of advanced writing.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Remember:<br>
        <strong>Grammar</strong> makes you correct.<br>
        <strong>Structure</strong> makes you clear.<br>
        <strong>Voice</strong> makes you memorable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Write with honesty. Edit with purpose. Let your essays speak for you – calmly,
        confidently, and always as yourself.
      </p>

        In the next unit, you will continue with
        <strong>Unit 19: Mastering the C2 Essay Task</strong>, where you will move beyond the C1
        structure and learn to write with the flexibility, sophistication, and intellectual confidence
        required for Cambridge Proficiency (C2) essays.
