    <h1>From Sentences to Paragraphs — The Bridge</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      You’ve built correct, stylish sentences. You’ve learned how to structure a paragraph around
      one clear idea. Now it’s time to bring everything together — to build <strong>flow</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      An essay isn’t just a collection of good paragraphs. It’s a connected argument, a journey the
      reader can follow without confusion or effort. This unit will show you how to link sentences
      and paragraphs so that your writing feels natural, logical, and alive — not a list of separate
      thoughts, but a continuous piece of reasoning.

    <!-- 1. Why flow matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-why">
      <h2>1. Why Flow Matters</h2>

      <p>
        When you read strong English writing, you almost don’t notice the transitions — ideas seem to
        slide smoothly from one to another. You never stop to think,
        <em>“Wait, what’s this sentence doing here?”</em>
      </p>

      <p><strong>The goal of flow:</strong></p>

      <p>
        Your reader should not have to work to understand how one idea connects to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine a river. Each paragraph is like a bend or stretch, but the water — your ideas — keeps
        moving. When your writing flows, the reader can naturally follow the current.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Paragraph islands -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-islands">
      <h2>2. The Problem: Paragraph Islands</h2>

      <p>
        Many learners write good paragraphs, but each one feels like an island — isolated, disconnected
        from the others. Consider this example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Many people believe that public transport should be free. It would encourage more people to leave their cars at home.</li>
        <li>Pollution is a serious problem in cities. There is too much traffic and the air quality is getting worse.</li>
        <li>The government should also build more bicycle lanes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each paragraph is correct, but they don’t talk to each other. There’s no bridge between the
        ideas, so the reader must jump from one island to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to <strong>build bridges</strong> — logical connections that make the essay feel like one united
        piece of writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Golden rule -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-golden">
      <h2>3. The Golden Rule: Every Paragraph Connects</h2>

      <p>
        Every new paragraph should grow naturally from the one before it. This connection can be:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>a logical link (cause &amp; effect, contrast, sequence)</li>
        <li>a reference to something earlier</li>
        <li>a connecting phrase or transition sentence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Think of your essay as a conversation with your reader. You never change the topic suddenly —
        you guide them gently from one point to another.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Linking sentences inside a paragraph -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-link-sentences">
      <h2>4. Linking Sentences Inside a Paragraph</h2>

      <p>
        Before we link whole paragraphs, we need to make sure the flow between
        <strong>sentences within each paragraph</strong> is smooth. Here are five techniques:
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Use reference words</h3>

      <p>
        Words like <strong>this, that, these, those, such, it, they</strong> help avoid repetition and connect ideas.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Air pollution is increasing in many cities. <strong>This</strong> problem affects people’s health.</li>
        <li>Some companies offer flexible schedules. <strong>Such</strong> policies improve work–life balance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>(b) Use repetition of key words — gently</h3>

      <p>
        Small repetition strengthens the paragraph:
      </p>

      <p><em>Education gives people opportunities. A good education system also reduces inequality.</em></p>

      <h3>(c) Use synonyms and related words</h3>

      <p>
        Instead of repeating the same word:
      </p>

      <p><em>The Internet has changed communication. Online platforms now shape how people share opinions.</em></p>

      <h3>(d) Use connecting adverbs</h3>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addition:</strong> furthermore, moreover, in addition</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> however, nevertheless</li>
        <li><strong>Result:</strong> therefore, consequently</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> first, then, afterwards</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> for instance, for example</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

      <p><em>
        Online education has many advantages. For instance, students can study at their own pace.
        However, it also requires self-discipline. Therefore, teachers must support students in
        managing their time.
      </em></p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Linking paragraphs together -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-link-paragraphs">
      <h2>5. Linking Paragraphs Together</h2>

      <p>
        Now let’s step up: from linking sentences to linking <strong>paragraphs</strong>.
        Every paragraph should open with something that connects back.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Use linking phrases at the start</h3>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Relationship</th><th>Linking phrase</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Adding a point</td><td>In addition, furthermore, what is more…</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Contrasting</td><td>However, on the other hand, in contrast…</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Result</td><td>Therefore, consequently, as a result…</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Developing</td><td>Building on this idea…</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Final point</td><td>Finally, in conclusion…</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>(b) Repeat a keyword or phrase</h3>

      <p><em>Social media has revolutionised communication.</em></p>
      <p><em><strong>This revolution</strong> has also changed how people form relationships.</em></p>

      <h3>(c) Use a question as a bridge</h3>

      <p><em>But are these technological changes always positive?</em></p>
      <p><em>In many cases, they are not…</em></p>

      <h3>(d) Use contrast and progression</h3>

      <p><em>
        On the one hand…<br>
        On the other hand…<br>
        In conclusion…
      </em></p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Transition sentences -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-transitions">
      <h2>6. Using Transition Sentences</h2>

      <p>
        A transition sentence sits at the end or beginning of a paragraph and connects two ideas.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

      <p><em>
        Education gives individuals the tools they need to find better jobs. However, the quality of
        education still depends heavily on social background.
      </em></p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Balancing unity and variety -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-balance">
      <h2>7. Balancing Unity and Variety</h2>

      <p>
        Each paragraph should feel distinct, but together they should form a single picture. Think of
        your essay as a team: each paragraph has a role, but all wear the same uniform.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unity:</strong> one clear idea per paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> mix long and short paragraphs, different rhythms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Example: connecting paragraphs -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-example">
      <h2>8. Example: Connecting Paragraphs</h2>

      <h3>Before (disconnected):</h3>

      <p><em>
        People should use public transport more. It’s cheaper and better for the environment.<br>
        Pollution is a big problem.<br>
        The government should improve train services.
      </em></p>

      <h3>After (connected):</h3>

      <p><em>
        People should use public transport more because it’s cheaper and better for the environment.
        In addition, it helps reduce traffic congestion in big cities. However, pollution remains a
        serious issue… As a result… To make this possible…
      </em></p>

      <p>
        The difference is <strong>flow</strong>.

    <!-- 9. From flow to style -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-flow-style">
      <h2>9. From Flow to Style</h2>

      <p>
        At higher levels (C1–C2), transitions become subtler. You don’t always need explicit connectors.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Basic:</strong><br>
        <em>I enjoy travelling. It helps me understand other cultures.</em>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Advanced:</strong><br>
        <em>Travelling broadens my understanding of other cultures.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The connection is built into the meaning — <strong>cohesion through logic</strong>.
      </p>

    <!-- 10. Practice -->
    <section class="unit-section practice-section" id="u8-practice">
      <h2>10. Practice: Build the Bridge</h2>

      <p>Try linking these paragraphs smoothly:</p>

      <p><em>
        Many people work long hours in order to earn more money. This can lead to stress and a lack of
        free time.
      </em></p>

      <p><em>
        Spending quality time with family and friends is essential for mental health.
      </em></p>

      <p><strong>Possible connection:</strong></p>

      <p><em>
        Many people work long hours… However, spending quality time with family and friends is
        essential…

    <!-- 11. Examiners and flow -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-examiners">
      <h2>11. How Cambridge Examiners See Flow</h2>

      <p>
        When examiners assess Organisation, they ask:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are ideas logically ordered?</li>
        <li>Are connectors used appropriately?</li>
        <li>Does the text read smoothly?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A Band 3 (C1) or Band 4 (C2) essay has paragraphs that link naturally, with transitions that
        feel invisible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 12. Final reflection -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-final">
      <h2>12. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Good writing is not about impressive vocabulary or long sentences. It’s about
        <strong>connection</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sentences make sense.<br>
        Paragraphs build ideas.<br>
        <strong>Flow makes writing human.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, you’ll apply everything — from sentence craft to paragraph unity — to write
        full Cambridge essays that communicate clearly, confidently, and with purpose.
