    <h1>From Sentences to Paragraphs — The Bridge</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      You have built correct, stylish sentences. You have learned how to structure a paragraph around one clear idea.
      Now it is time to bring everything together and focus on <strong>flow</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      An essay is not just a collection of good paragraphs. It is a connected argument – a journey the reader can
      follow without confusion or effort.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, you will learn how to link sentences and paragraphs so that your writing feels natural, logical,
      and alive – not a list of separate thoughts, but a continuous piece of reasoning.

    <!-- 1. Why flow matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-flow">
      <h2>1. Why Flow Matters</h2>

      <p>
        When you read strong English writing, you almost do not notice the transitions. Ideas seem to slide smoothly
        from one to another. You never stop and think: “Wait, what is this sentence doing here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        That is the goal of <strong>flow</strong>: to make the connections in your writing feel invisible.
        Your reader should not have to work to understand how one idea leads to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine a river. Each paragraph is like a bend or stretch in the river, but the water – your ideas – keeps
        moving. When your writing flows, the reader can naturally follow the current.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Paragraph islands -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-islands">
      <h2 id="u8-point">2. The Problem: Paragraph Islands</h2>

      <p>
        Many learners write paragraphs that are correct inside, but disconnected from each other. Each paragraph feels
        like an island.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example (disconnected paragraphs):</strong></p>

      <p class="example">
        Many people believe that public transport should be free. It would encourage more people to leave their cars at home.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Pollution is a serious problem in cities. There is too much traffic and the air quality is getting worse.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        The government should also build more bicycle lanes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each paragraph is reasonable, but they do not “talk” to each other. There is no bridge between the ideas, so
        the reader must jump from one island to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to <strong>build bridges</strong> – logical connections that make the essay feel like one united
        piece of writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Golden rule -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-golden-rule">
      <h2>3. The Golden Rule: Every Paragraph Connects</h2>

      <p>
        Every new paragraph should grow naturally from the one before it. There should always be a clear relationship
        between what you have just said and what you are going to say next.
      </p>

      <p>This connection can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a logical link (cause and effect, contrast, sequence)</li>
        <li>a reference back to something earlier</li>
        <li>a connecting phrase or transition sentence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Think of your essay as a conversation with your reader. You never change the topic suddenly; you guide them
        gently from one point to another.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Linking sentences inside a paragraph -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-linking-sentences">
      <h2 id="u8-explanation">4. Linking Sentences Inside a Paragraph</h2>

      <p>
        Before linking whole paragraphs, you need to make sure the <strong>sentences inside each paragraph</strong>
        flow smoothly. Here are four key techniques.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.1 Use reference words</h3>
        <p>
          Words like <em>this, that, these, those, such, it, they</em> help you avoid repetition and show connections.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Air pollution is increasing in many cities. <strong>This</strong> problem affects people’s health.<br>
          Some companies offer flexible schedules. <strong>Such</strong> policies improve work–life balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          In each case, the reference word points back to the previous sentence and keeps the reader on track.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.2 Repeat key words – but gently</h3>
        <p>
          Repeating important words can strengthen unity, but do it in a controlled way so the paragraph does not sound
          robotic.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Education gives people opportunities. A good <strong>education</strong> system also reduces inequality.
        </p>

        <p>
          The small repetition of <em>education</em> reminds the reader of the main focus.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.3 Use synonyms and related words</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of repeating the exact same word, you can use a related word or phrase to keep the same idea alive.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Internet has changed <strong>communication</strong>. Online platforms now shape how people
          <strong>share opinions</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, <em>communication</em> becomes <em>sharing opinions</em> – the same theme, new wording.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.4 Use connecting adverbs</h3>
        <p>
          Connecting adverbs show the relationship between sentences.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Addition:</strong> moreover, furthermore, in addition, also</li>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> however, on the other hand, nevertheless</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> therefore, as a result, consequently, thus</li>
          <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> first(ly), then, afterwards, finally</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> for example, for instance</li>
          <li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> indeed, in fact, above all</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p><em>
          Online education has many advantages. <strong>For instance</strong>, students can study at their own pace.
          <strong>However</strong>, it also requires self-discipline. <strong>Therefore</strong>, teachers must support
          students in managing their time.
        </em></p>

        <p>
          The clear progression of connectors keeps the paragraph alive and connected.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Linking paragraphs together -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-linking-paragraphs">
      <h2 id="u8-linking">5. Linking Paragraphs Together</h2>

      <p>
        Now we step up: from linking sentences to linking <strong>paragraphs</strong>.
        Each new paragraph should start with something that connects back to what came before.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.1 Linking phrases at the start of a paragraph</h3>
        <p>These phrases show how the next idea relates to the previous one.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Relationship</th>
              <th>Useful linking phrases</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Adding a similar idea</td>
              <td>In addition, Furthermore, What is more, Another important point is that…</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Contrasting an idea</td>
              <td>However, On the other hand, In contrast, Despite this…</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Giving a reason or result</td>
              <td>Therefore, Consequently, As a result, For this reason…</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Developing the previous point</td>
              <td>Building on this idea, Following this argument, Similarly…</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Introducing a final or opposite point</td>
              <td>Finally, In conclusion, On the contrary, Nevertheless…</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> Public transport helps reduce traffic congestion. It also lowers pollution in large cities.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> <strong>In addition,</strong> free or cheaper public transport could make travel more accessible to low-income families.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now the second paragraph continues the idea instead of jumping away from it.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.2 Repeat a keyword or phrase</h3>
        <p>
          Repeating a keyword from the previous paragraph can subtly maintain continuity.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>End of paragraph 1:</strong> Social media has revolutionised communication.<br>
          <strong>Start of paragraph 2:</strong> <em>This revolution</em> has also changed how people form relationships.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.3 Use a question as a bridge</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, you can end a paragraph with a question that the next one answers.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>End of paragraph 1:</strong> <em>But are these technological changes always positive?</em><br>
          <strong>Start of paragraph 2:</strong> <em>In many cases, they are not. Excessive dependence on technology can reduce face-to-face interaction.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.4 Use contrast and progression</h3>
        <p>
          Good essays often move through contrast and development:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Paragraph 1: one side of the argument</li>
          <li>Paragraph 2: the other side</li>
          <li>Paragraph 3: your conclusion or balanced view</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Example (B2 essay):</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          Paragraph 1: On the one hand, advertising helps people learn about new products and services.<br>
          Paragraph 2: On the other hand, too much advertising can be manipulative and misleading.<br>
          Paragraph 3: In my view, although advertising can be excessive, it remains a necessary part of modern business.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each paragraph reacts to the one before it. Your essay becomes a dialogue with itself.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Using transition sentences -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-transitions">
      <h2>6. Using Transition Sentences</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>transition sentence</strong> sits at the end or beginning of a paragraph and connects two ideas.
        It is like a bridge built from one bank to the other.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        End of paragraph 1: <em>Education gives individuals the tools they need to find better jobs.</em><br>
        Start of paragraph 2: <em>However, the quality of education still depends heavily on social background.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The reader now understands why the next paragraph exists – it continues the conversation instead of interrupting it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Another example:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>Although cities offer great opportunities, they also present serious problems such as overcrowding and pollution.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        That single sentence can prepare the reader for a new paragraph about the problems of city life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Balancing unity and variety -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-balance">
      <h2>7. Balancing Unity and Variety</h2>

      <p>
        Each paragraph should feel distinct, but together they should form a single picture. Think of your essay as a
        team: each paragraph plays a different role, but they all wear the same uniform.
      </p>

      <p>Check two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unity:</strong> Each paragraph develops one clear idea.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Your paragraphs do not all sound the same in rhythm or structure.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You can vary length (within the word limit) and internal rhythm. A Cambridge essay with identical paragraphs
        sounds mechanical; variety gives it life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Example: connecting paragraphs -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-example-flow">
      <h2 id="u8-example">8. Example: Connecting Paragraphs in Practice</h2>

      <p>Compare these two versions.</p>

      <p><strong>Before (disconnected):</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        People should use public transport more. It’s cheaper and better for the environment.<br>
        Pollution is a big problem. The air in many cities is unhealthy.<br>
        The government should improve train services.
      </p>

      <p><strong>After (connected):</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        People should use public transport more because it’s cheaper and better for the environment.
        <strong>In addition</strong>, it helps reduce traffic congestion in big cities.
        <strong>However</strong>, pollution remains a serious issue. The air in many cities is still unhealthy,
        especially during rush hours. <strong>As a result</strong>, encouraging more citizens to use public transport
        could make a real difference. <strong>To make this possible</strong>, the government should improve train
        services and offer affordable monthly passes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ideas now build on each other – clear, connected, and natural. That is the power of flow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 9. From flow to style -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u8-style">
      <h2>9. From Flow to Style</h2>

      <p>
        At higher levels (C1–C2), transitions become subtler. You do not always need explicit connectors; sometimes
        logic and word choice create the link naturally.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Compare:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        Basic: <em>I enjoy travelling. It helps me understand other cultures.</em><br>
        Advanced: <em>Travelling broadens my understanding of other cultures.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the advanced version, the connection is built into the sentence itself. This is called
        <strong>cohesion by meaning</strong>, not by a visible connector.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in Cambridge exams, clarity always comes before elegance. If you are unsure, use a clear connector.
        It is better to be simple and clear than stylish but confusing.

      <h2>11. How Cambridge Examiners See Flow</h2>

      <p>
        When examiners assess <strong>Organisation</strong>, they ask:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are ideas logically ordered?</li>
        <li>Are connectors and transitions used appropriately?</li>
        <li>Does the text read smoothly without confusion?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A Band 3 (C1) or Band 4 (C2) essay has paragraphs that link naturally, with transitions that feel almost
        invisible. The reader should glide through your writing, never stumble or stop.

      <h2>12. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Good writing is not only about impressive vocabulary or long sentences. It is about <strong>connection</strong>:
        between ideas, between paragraphs, and ultimately between writer and reader.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you link your sentences and paragraphs with care, you show control, logic, and confidence. You show that
        your ideas belong together – and that you know how to guide your reader from start to finish.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Sentences make sense.<br>
        Paragraphs build ideas.<br>
