    <h1>Planning and Brainstorming</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      When you sit down to write your Cambridge essay, it’s tempting to start writing immediately.
      You look at the question, come up with a few ideas, and begin your first sentence.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      But halfway through, you realise your examples repeat, your ideas don’t connect, or you’ve
      forgotten one of the notes. That’s the danger of skipping the plan.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      A few minutes of planning can transform your essay — not by adding more words, but by giving
      every sentence a purpose.

      <h2>1. Why Planning Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Many students think planning wastes time.
        In reality, it <strong>saves</strong> time — and marks.
      </p>

      <p>Without a plan, your essay often becomes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>unbalanced</strong> – too much about one idea, not enough about the other;</li>
        <li><strong>repetitive</strong> – the same argument said twice in different words;</li>
        <li><strong>unfinished</strong> – you run out of time before the conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With a plan, you write faster, stay focused, and make fewer mistakes.
        Think of planning as <strong>building the map</strong> before starting your journey.
        You wouldn’t drive to an unknown city without checking where you are going first.
        The same is true for writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-time">
      <h2>2. How Much Time to Spend</h2>

      <p>
        In the B2 exam, you have <strong>about 40 minutes</strong> for the essay.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>5–7 minutes to plan</li>
        <li>25 minutes to write</li>
        <li>5 minutes to check</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those first few minutes of planning are crucial. They make your writing smoother, more precise,
        and more confident.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-read-task">
      <h2>3. Step 1 – Read the Task Carefully</h2>

      <p>Look at this real-style question:</p>

      <p><em>
        In your English class you have been talking about how to stay healthy.<br>
        Now your teacher has asked you to write an essay.<br><br>
        Write an essay using all the notes and giving reasons for your point of view.<br><br>
        Some people say that the best way to stay healthy is to do regular exercise.
      </em></p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>diet</li>
        <li>stress</li>
        <li>your own idea</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This looks simple — but many students lose marks here because they don’t read carefully.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must <strong>use all the notes</strong> (1, 2, and your own idea).
        That means your essay needs at least three arguments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>one about diet,</li>
        <li>one about stress,</li>
        <li>one extra idea (your choice).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> underline or circle key words in the question before you start writing.
        It helps you focus on what you must include.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-analyse">
      <h2>4. Step 2 – Analyse the Question</h2>

      <p>Before you think of ideas, ask yourself:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>What is the topic?</strong> → How to stay healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the main question?</strong> → Is regular exercise the best way?</li>
        <li><strong>What are the three notes I need to mention?</strong> → diet, stress, my own idea.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once you understand this, you already have your essay outline:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> Introduction (state the topic and your opinion)</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> First note (diet)</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Second note (stress) + your own idea</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> Conclusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You haven’t written a word yet, but your structure is already taking shape.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-brainstorm">
      <h2>5. Step 3 – Brainstorm Ideas</h2>

      <p>
        Now comes the creative part. Before you write, spend one minute quickly noting down
        <strong>any ideas</strong> that come to mind for each note.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example brainstorm:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet</strong><br>
          Eating too much fast food → unhealthy; balanced diet helps energy; avoid sugar; governments
          should educate people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress</strong><br>
          Causes illness, poor sleep, anxiety; relaxation helps; doing sports reduces stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Own idea (rest &amp; lifestyle)</strong><br>
          Sleep and rest are vital; mental health; social connections; spending time outside.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Write them fast — don’t judge them yet.
        The goal is to get ideas out of your head and onto paper. You can choose the best ones later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-choose">
      <h2>6. Step 4 – Choose Your Main Points</h2>

      <p>
        Once you’ve listed ideas, select one <strong>strong</strong> point for each note — one you can explain easily
        and clearly in two or three sentences.
      </p>

      <p><strong>For our example:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diet:</strong> A healthy diet gives the body energy and prevents illness.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Exercise helps reduce stress and makes people feel better.</li>
        <li><strong>Own idea:</strong> Enough rest and sleep are just as important as physical activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now you have your three main points. They’ll become the heart of your essay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-outline">
      <h2>7. Step 5 – Plan the Paragraphs (The Mini-Outline)</h2>

      <p>Let’s turn those points into a quick, visual plan.</p>

      <p>Your plan should be short — no full sentences, just notes. For example:</p>

      <pre>
Essay question: Best way to stay healthy → exercise?

Introduction
- introduce topic + opinion
- many ways to stay healthy; exercise important but not the only one

Paragraph 1 (diet)
- balanced diet → energy, immunity
- fast food causes problems

Paragraph 2 (stress)
- exercise reduces stress
- mental health benefits

Paragraph 3 (own idea)
- enough sleep + rest
- emotional wellbeing; balance

Conclusion
- exercise important, but real health = body + mind balance
      </pre>

      <p>
        That’s it — your map.
        It takes about five minutes, but now you can write smoothly for 25 minutes without stopping to
        think, “What’s next?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-connectors">
      <h2>8. Step 6 – Add Connectors and Transitions</h2>

      <p>
        Once your ideas are chosen, decide how to connect them.
        Smooth transitions make your essay coherent and easy to follow.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Useful linking words:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding ideas:</strong> moreover, in addition, also, what is more</li>
        <li><strong>Contrasting:</strong> however, on the other hand, although, whereas</li>
        <li><strong>Explaining results:</strong> therefore, as a result, consequently</li>
        <li><strong>Giving examples:</strong> for example, for instance</li>
        <li><strong>Summarising:</strong> in conclusion, to sum up, overall</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need to write these in your plan, but visualising them now saves time later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-idea-builders">
      <h2>9. Step 7 – Use “Idea Builders”</h2>

      <p>
        When brainstorming, it helps to think in <strong>idea builders</strong> — simple formulas that help you
        expand your points logically.
        Here are three that work beautifully for the B2 essay.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Cause → Effect → Example</h3>

      <p><em>
        Eating a balanced diet keeps the body strong → it prevents disease → for example, people who eat
        more vegetables usually have fewer health problems.
      </em></p>

      <h3>(b) Problem → Solution</h3>

      <p><em>
        Stress affects health negatively → regular exercise helps release tension → this improves
        concentration and mood.
      </em></p>

      <h3>(c) General → Specific</h3>

      <p><em>
        Good health depends on balance → this means caring for both body and mind → rest and social
        connection are just as important as exercise.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        These mini-structures help you expand ideas without repeating yourself.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-opinion">
      <h2>10. Step 8 – Plan Your Opinion</h2>

      <p>
        In a Cambridge essay, you must give your opinion, but you can do it in different ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>in the introduction:</strong> <em>Personally, I believe…</em></li>
        <li><strong>in the conclusion:</strong> <em>For this reason, I think…</em></li>
        <li><strong>or both:</strong> start neutral, end with a clear opinion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

      <p><em>
        Many people think exercise is the best way to stay healthy, but there are other important
        factors.
      </em></p>

      <p><em>
        In my view, exercise is essential, but it should be combined with good nutrition and enough
        rest.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        Balanced opinions sound more thoughtful — and Cambridge examiners appreciate that.
        Avoid extreme or emotional statements like <em>“Exercise is the only way!”</em> or
        <em>“People who don’t exercise are lazy.”</em> Keep your tone calm and analytical.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-visualise">
      <h2>11. Step 9 – Visualise Your Essay</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you have your plan, imagine how it will look on the page.
        Each paragraph will have its own job — no more, no less.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example structure:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Title (optional in the exam):</strong> How Can We Stay Healthy?</li>
        <li><strong>Introduction (≈30 words):</strong> general topic; mention both sides; state your opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Paragraph 1 (≈50 words):</strong> diet – balanced meals, energy, prevention of illness; example: avoiding sugar, eating more vegetables.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Paragraph 2 (≈50 words):</strong> stress – exercise reduces tension and anxiety; example: running, yoga, team sports improve mood.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Paragraph 3 (≈50 words):</strong> own idea – rest, mental health, emotional balance; example: enough sleep, spending time outside.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion (≈25 words):</strong> true health = combination of factors; final thought or recommendation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-overplanning">
      <h2>12. Step 10 – Avoid Overplanning</h2>

      <p>
        Some students fall into the opposite trap: they plan too much.
        They write full sentences, arrows, long lists — and then have no time to write the essay itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your plan should be short and visual — a <strong>sketch</strong>, not a sculpture.
        If you can glance at it and immediately know what to write next, it’s perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t get marks for your plan, but it’s the foundation for everything that follows.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-flexible">
      <h2>13. Step 11 – Stay Flexible</h2>

      <p>
        Even with a plan, your ideas may change while writing. That’s fine.
        The plan is a guide, not a prison.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a new idea appears that fits the question better, include it — but stay logical.
        Never skip one of the notes, and always check your word count.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examiners love essays that feel natural, not memorised.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-practise">
      <h2>14. Step 12 – Practise Planning Only</h2>

      <p>
        Before your next practice essay, try this exercise:
        <strong>plan without writing</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take five different essay questions and spend exactly five minutes on each plan. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Some people say school should focus more on creativity than exams.</li>
        <li>The best way to learn a language is by living in the country where it is spoken.</li>
        <li>Technology has improved communication, but it has also made people more isolated.</li>
        <li>Young people should do unpaid work to help their community.</li>
        <li>Happiness depends on money.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After five plans, you’ll notice patterns: how to organise, balance arguments, and find logical
        examples fast. That’s what turns you into a confident exam writer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-plan-writing">
      <h2>15. From Plan to Writing</h2>

      <p>
        Once your plan is ready, writing becomes almost automatic.
        You already know what each paragraph will say — all that’s left is to join the dots with your
        sentence and paragraph skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you plan, you don’t just prepare your essay; you prepare your <strong>thinking</strong>.
        You decide what’s important, what comes first, and what supports your message.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-self-check">
      <h2>16. Quick Self-Check Before Writing</h2>

      <p>Before you begin your essay, ask yourself:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>✅ Did I understand the question?</li>
        <li>✅ Did I include all three notes?</li>
        <li>✅ Do I know what each paragraph will say?</li>
        <li>✅ Do I have one clear opinion?</li>
        <li>✅ Do I have time to finish?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If all five answers are yes — start writing. You’re ready.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-final">
      <h2>17. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Planning isn’t a waste of time — it’s the secret to clarity.
        It’s what separates a rushed essay from a focused, confident one.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need to write more to score higher. You need to plan better.
        Every minute you spend organising your ideas adds calm, logic, and flow to your writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        That calmness is what the examiner feels when reading your essay.
        It’s what earns you the higher band.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
        Plan first, write second, succeed third.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, we’ll move to <strong>Unit 11: Editing for Accuracy</strong>, where you’ll learn how to
        check your essay like an examiner — fixing grammar, punctuation, and word choice in a calm,
        strategic way to make your writing shine.
