      When you sit down to write your Cambridge essay, it is tempting to start writing immediately.
      You look at the question, think of a few ideas, and begin your first sentence.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      But halfway through, you may realise your examples repeat, your ideas do not connect,
      or you have forgotten one of the notes. That is the danger of skipping the plan.

      A few minutes of planning can transform your essay – not by adding more words,
      but by giving every sentence a clear purpose.

    <!-- 1. Why planning matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-why-planning">
      <h2>1. Why Planning Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Many students think planning wastes time. In reality, it <strong>saves</strong> time – and marks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without a plan, your essay often becomes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>unbalanced</strong> – too much about one idea, not enough about another,</li>
        <li><strong>repetitive</strong> – the same argument said twice,</li>
        <li><strong>unfinished</strong> – you run out of time before the conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With a plan, you write faster, stay focused, and make fewer mistakes.
        Think of planning as <strong>building the map</strong> before starting your journey.
        You would not drive to an unknown city without checking where you are going first.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. How much time to spend -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-time">
      <h2>2. How Much Time to Spend</h2>

      <p>
        In the B2 exam, you have about <strong>40 minutes</strong> for the essay. A good time plan is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>5–7 minutes:</strong> plan your ideas and structure,</li>
        <li><strong>25 minutes:</strong> write your essay,</li>
        <li><strong>5 minutes:</strong> check and correct.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those first few minutes of planning are crucial. They make your writing smoother, more precise,
        and more confident.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Step 1 – Read the task carefully -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step1">
      <h2>3. Step 1 – Read the Task Carefully</h2>

      <p>Look at this real-style question:</p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example task</h3>
        <p><em>
          In your English class you have been talking about how to stay healthy.
          Now your teacher has asked you to write an essay.
        </em></p>
        <p><em>
          Write an essay using all the notes and giving reasons for your point of view.
        </em></p>

        <p><strong>Some people say that the best way to stay healthy is to do regular exercise.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. diet</li>
          <li>2. stress</li>
          <li>3. your own idea</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        This looks simple – but many students lose marks because they do not read carefully.
        You <strong>must use all the notes</strong> (1, 2, and your own idea).
        That means your essay needs at least three arguments: one about <em>diet</em>, one about
        <em>stress</em>, and one extra idea.
      </p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Before you start writing, underline or circle key words in the question.
          It helps you focus on what you <em>must</em> include.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Step 2 – Analyse the question -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step2">
      <h2>4. Step 2 – Analyse the Question</h2>

      <p>Before you think of ideas, ask yourself:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>What is the topic?</strong> → How to stay healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the main question?</strong> → Is regular exercise the best way?</li>
        <li><strong>What are the three notes?</strong> → diet, stress, your own idea.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once you understand this, you already have your essay outline:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> Introduction (state the topic and opinion)</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> First note (diet)</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Second note (stress) + your own idea</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> Conclusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You have not written a word yet, but your structure is already taking shape.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Step 3 – Brainstorm ideas -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step3">
      <h2>5. Step 3 – Brainstorm Ideas</h2>

      <p>
        Now comes the creative part. Before you write, spend one minute quickly noting down any ideas that
        come to mind for each note.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet:</strong> eating too much fast food → unhealthy; balanced diet helps energy;
          avoid sugar; governments should educate people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress:</strong> causes illness, poor sleep, anxiety; relaxation helps; doing sports
          reduces stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your own idea:</strong> sleep and rest are vital; mental health; social connections;
          spending time outside.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Write ideas fast – do not judge them yet. The goal is to get ideas out of your head and onto paper.
        You can choose the best ones later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Step 4 – Choose your main points -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step4">
      <h2>6. Step 4 – Choose Your Main Points</h2>

      <p>
        Once you have a list, select one <strong>strong</strong> point for each note – something you can explain
        clearly in two or three sentences.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example choices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diet:</strong> A healthy diet gives the body energy and prevents illness.</li>
          <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Exercise helps reduce stress and makes people feel better.</li>
          <li><strong>Own idea:</strong> Enough rest and sleep are just as important as physical activity.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        Now you have your <strong>three main points</strong>. They will become the heart of your essay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step5">
      <h2>7. Step 5 – Plan the Paragraphs (The Mini-Outline)</h2>

      <p>
        Turn your points into a quick, visual plan. Your plan should be short – no full sentences, just notes.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Sample mini-outline</h3>
        <p><strong>Essay question:</strong> Best way to stay healthy → exercise?</p>

        <ul class="breakdown-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Introduction:</strong> introduce topic and opinion – many ways to stay healthy; exercise important
            but not the only factor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paragraph 1 (diet):</strong> balanced diet → energy, immunity; fast food causes problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paragraph 2 (stress):</strong> exercise reduces stress; mental health benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paragraph 3 (own idea):</strong> enough sleep and rest; emotional wellbeing; balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> exercise is important, but real health = body + mind balance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        That is your map. It takes about five minutes, but now you can write smoothly for 25 minutes
        without stopping to think, “What is next?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Step 6 – Add connectors and transitions -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u10-step6">
      <h2 id="u10-cohesion">8. Step 6 – Add Connectors and Transitions</h2>

      <p>
        Once your ideas are chosen, decide how to connect them. Smooth transitions make your essay
        <strong>coherent</strong> and easy to follow.
      </p>

      <p>Use linking words you already know:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding ideas:</strong> moreover, in addition, also, what is more</li>
        <li><strong>Contrasting:</strong> however, on the other hand, although, whereas</li>
        <li><strong>Explaining results:</strong> therefore, as a result, consequently</li>
        <li><strong>Giving examples:</strong> for example, for instance</li>
        <li><strong>Summarising:</strong> in conclusion, to sum up, overall</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You do not need to write these words into your plan, but imagining where they will go
        will make your writing more cohesive.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3 id="u10-overuse">8.1 Avoid overusing connectors</h3>
        <p>
          Connectors are helpful, but too many can make your writing feel heavy and mechanical.
          You do not need a linking word in <em>every</em> sentence.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example (too many connectors):</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          Firstly, exercise is important. Secondly, it helps people relax. Thirdly, it also improves sleep.
          Finally, it is good for social life.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Improved:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          Exercise is important because it keeps the body strong and healthy. It also helps people relax and
          sleep better, and it can improve their social life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use connectors when they <strong>add clarity</strong>, not just to fill space.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3 id="u10-variety">8.2 Use a variety of linking words</h3>
        <p>
          Repeating the same connector again and again (for example, always using <em>also</em>) makes your essay sound
          basic. Show range by using different, natural alternatives.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Instead of:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          Also… Also… Also…
        </p>

        <p><strong>Try:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          Furthermore… In addition… What is more…
        </p>

        <p>
          A small variety in linking words immediately makes your writing feel more advanced and more cohesive.

      <h2>10. Step 8 – Plan Your Opinion</h2>

      <p>
        In a Cambridge essay, you <strong>must</strong> give your opinion, but you can decide where to show it:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>in the introduction (e.g. <em>Personally, I believe…</em>)</li>
        <li>in the conclusion (e.g. <em>For this reason, I think…</em>)</li>
        <li>or both – start neutral and finish with a clear view.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Many people think exercise is the best way to stay healthy, but there are other important factors.

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          In my view, exercise is essential, but it should be combined with good nutrition and enough rest.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Balanced opinions sound more thoughtful – and Cambridge examiners appreciate that.
        Avoid extreme, emotional statements like <em>“People who don’t exercise are lazy.”</em>

        Some students fall into the opposite trap: they plan too much. They write full sentences, arrows,
        and long lists – and then have no time to write the essay itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your plan should be short and visual – a <strong>sketch</strong>, not a sculpture. If you can glance at it

        Even with a plan, your ideas may change while writing – and that is fine.
        The plan is a guide, not a prison.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        Before your next practice essay, try this exercise: <strong>plan without writing</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take five different essay questions and spend exactly five minutes on each plan. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>School should focus more on creativity than exams.</li>
        <li>The best way to learn a language is by living in the country where it is spoken.</li>
        <li>Technology has improved communication, but it has also made people more isolated.</li>
        <li>Young people should do unpaid work to help their community.</li>
        <li>Happiness depends on money.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After five plans, you will notice patterns: how to organise, balance arguments, and find logical
        examples quickly. That is what turns you into a confident exam writer.

        Once your plan is ready, writing becomes almost automatic. You already know what each paragraph will say –
        all that is left is to join the dots with your sentence and paragraph skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you plan, you do not just prepare your essay; you prepare your <strong>thinking</strong>.
        You decide what is important, what comes first, and what supports your message.
      </p>

      <p>

        Planning is not a waste of time – it is the secret to clarity. It is what separates a rushed essay
        from a focused, confident one.
      </p>

      <p>
        You do not need to write more to score higher; you need to <strong>plan better</strong>. Every minute you spend
        organising your ideas adds calm, logic, and flow to your writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        That calmness is what the examiner feels when reading your essay – and it is what earns you the higher band.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: plan first, write second, succeed third.

  <h2>Summary & Quick Reference</h2>

  <p>
    Unit 10 shows you how to plan a <strong>B2 essay</strong> so that your writing is 
    clear, organised, and easier to write under time pressure. A good plan does not 
    need full sentences; it just needs <strong>clear decisions</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>1) The 3–Step Planning Process</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the task</strong><br>
      → What is the <em>topic</em>?<br>
      → What <em>question</em> do you need to answer?<br>
      → Do you need to <em>choose an opinion</em>, <em>discuss advantages/disadvantages</em>, or <em>give a solution</em>?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose your position</strong><br>
      → Do you mostly agree, mostly disagree, or have a balanced view?<br>
      → Decide this <em>before</em> you start.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Make a quick outline</strong><br>
      → Intro = topic + question + your opinion<br>
      → Body 1 = main reason 1 (+ example)<br>
      → Body 2 = main reason 2 (+ example / contrast)<br>
      → Conclusion = short summary + restate opinion
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="formula">
    <strong>Plan = 4 lines: Intro – Reason 1 – Reason 2 – Conclusion</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>2) A Sample B2 Essay Plan</h3>

  <p><strong>Task:</strong> “Some people think homework is necessary; others say it is a waste of time. Write an essay giving your opinion.”</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Intro:</strong> Homework is a common part of school; people disagree about its value. <em>(My view: homework is useful if not excessive.)</em></li>
    <li><strong>Body 1:</strong> Helps students practise what they learned in class – improves memory and exam results. Example: revising grammar or vocabulary at home.</li>
    <li><strong>Body 2:</strong> Can be stressful if there is too much; families have less free time. However, reasonable homework teaches responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Homework is helpful when teachers give a fair amount and clear tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Notice: short notes, no full sentences, but the <strong>whole essay is already decided</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Timing Guide (for a 40-minute writing task)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Planning:</strong> 5–7 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Writing:</strong> about 25 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Checking:</strong> 5–8 minutes (spelling, punctuation, linking words)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you skip the planning stage, you often lose more time later trying to fix the structure.
  </p>

  <h3>4) Useful “Planning Phrases” for B2 Essays</h3>

  <p><strong>Introductions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Many people believe that…”</li>
    <li>“Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion about…”</li>
    <li>“In this essay, I will discuss…” (safe at B2)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Giving reasons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>“One important reason is that…”</li>
    <li>“Another advantage is that…”</li>
    <li>“On the other hand, some people argue that…”</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>“In conclusion, I believe that…”</li>
    <li>“To sum up, it seems that…”</li>
    <li>“Overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks because…”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) Common Planning Mistakes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No plan at all:</strong> ideas become repeated or unbalanced.</li>
    <li><strong>Too many ideas:</strong> five or six small points, none of them properly developed.</li>
    <li><strong>Changing opinion halfway:</strong> the introduction and conclusion do not match.</li>
    <li><strong>Writing the whole essay in the plan:</strong> you waste time; use notes and arrows only.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Safe rule:</strong> choose 2 strong reasons and develop them clearly.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>6) Mini Practice – Plan in 3 Lines</h3>

  <p><strong>Topic:</strong> “More and more people are working from home. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?”</p>

  <p>Try to write a <strong>3–line plan</strong> in your notebook:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Intro → your opinion in one short phrase</li>
    <li>Body 1 → main advantage (+ quick example)</li>
    <li>Body 2 → main disadvantage / limit (+ quick example)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If your plan is clear, writing the essay will feel more relaxed and controlled.
