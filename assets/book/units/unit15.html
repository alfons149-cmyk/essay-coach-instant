<h2>Unit 15: Writing and Linking C1 Paragraphs</h2>
<p class="unit-source">Source: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

<p>
By now, you know how to analyse a C1 essay question and create a logical plan.  
You can identify the two opinions, form your own view, and clearly map out your ideas.
</p>

<p>
Now it’s time to turn that plan into writing — not just sentences, but paragraphs that flow,
connect, and sound mature.
</p>

<p>This unit will teach you how to write C1-level paragraphs that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>express complex ideas clearly,</li>
  <li>use logical and stylistic linking,</li>
  <li>maintain a calm, natural rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, we’ll learn how to move beyond structure and into <strong>flow</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What Makes a C1 Paragraph Different</h2>

<p>
At B2 level, a good paragraph is one clear idea with a few supporting sentences.  
At C1 level, the same rule applies — but you need to go deeper.
</p>

<p>C1 paragraphs show:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Balance</strong> — they present an idea and acknowledge other perspectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Development</strong> — they include examples, explanations, and mini-conclusions.</li>
  <li><strong>Variety</strong> — they use a mix of sentence structures for rhythm.</li>
  <li><strong>Cohesion</strong> — ideas link smoothly to what comes before and after.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In short:</strong><br>
B2 paragraphs explain. <strong>C1 paragraphs explore.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Structure: The “Deep PEEL” Model</h2>

<p>
At this level, we expand the familiar model (Point – Evidence – Explain – Link)
into a more flexible version:
</p>

<h3>PEEL</h3>

<p><strong>P – Point</strong><br>
Introduce the main idea clearly.<br>
<em>Job satisfaction improves motivation.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>E – Evidence</strong><br>
Add support (example, fact, or situation).<br>
<em>For example, people who enjoy their work often perform better.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>E – Explain</strong><br>
Show why the idea is true or important.<br>
<em>This is because enjoyment increases creativity and persistence.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>L – Link</strong><br>
Connect to the essay’s main question or next paragraph.<br>
<em>Nevertheless, not everyone has the luxury of choosing a job they love.</em>
</p>

<h3>C1 Extension: Evaluate (E²)</h3>
<p>
Offer a balanced or reflective comment.<br>
<em>Therefore, while satisfaction is desirable, stability may sometimes take priority.</em>
</p>

<p>This final “Evaluate” stage is what examiners notice. It shows critical thinking.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Example: Deep PEEL in Action</h2>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Technology and convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph Example:</strong></p>

<div class="example">
<p>
One clear advantage of modern technology is that it has made communication faster and more convenient.
For instance, online platforms allow people to stay in contact regardless of distance.
This saves both time and money, making it easier to maintain friendships or work relationships.
However, this constant availability can also increase stress, as people feel pressure to respond immediately.
Overall, while technology has improved communication, it has also blurred the line between work and personal life.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>It begins clearly.</li>
  <li>It gives examples.</li>
  <li>It shows understanding of both sides.</li>
  <li>It ends with a reflective evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what examiners mean by “shows awareness of complexity.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Linking Within a Paragraph</h2>

<p>At C1, sentences must flow naturally. Use linking with a light touch.</p>

<h3>(a) Logical connectors (subtle and natural)</h3>

<p>Use them sparingly.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
<tr><td>Addition</td><td>moreover, in addition, what is more</td></tr>
<tr><td>Contrast</td><td>however, nevertheless, yet, whereas</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cause/result</td><td>therefore, thus, consequently, as a result</td></tr>
<tr><td>Example</td><td>for instance, for example, such as</td></tr>
<tr><td>Emphasis</td><td>indeed, in fact, above all, particularly</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Avoid overuse</strong> — too many connectors sound mechanical.</p>

<h3>(b) Reference words</h3>

<p>Pronouns create smooth flow.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>This</strong> change affects how people work, communicate, and relax.</li>
  <li><strong>Such</strong> initiatives are essential for the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(c) Thematic repetition</h3>
<p>Use synonyms to keep unity:</p>
<p><em>education → learning → schooling → academic development</em></p>

<h3>(d) Sentence variety</h3>
<p>Mix short and long sentences for rhythm.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Linking Between Paragraphs</h2>

<p>B2 uses simple transitions.<br>
C1 uses <strong>subtle logical bridges</strong>.</p>

<h3>(a) Transitional Phrases</h3>

<table>
<tr><th>Paragraph Function</th><th>Useful Starters</th></tr>
<tr><td>First argument</td><td>To begin with…</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opposing view</td><td>Nevertheless…</td></tr>
<tr><td>Further development</td><td>Furthermore…</td></tr>
<tr><td>Conclusion</td><td>Overall…</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>(b) Logical Echo</h3>
<p><em>This transformation</em> pulls the reader forward.</p>

<h3>(c) The Contrast Bridge</h3>
<p>End one paragraph with a “but” idea, start the next with the continuation.</p>

<h3>(d) Balance Signal</h3>
<p>Use phrases that show nuanced thought.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Developing Paragraph Depth</h2>

<h3>(a) Cause and Effect</h3>

<p>Because + consequence.</p>

<h3>(b) Consequences</h3>
<p>As a result…</p>

<h3>(c) Qualification</h3>
<p>“but” ideas add nuance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Building Sentence Flexibility</h2>

<p>Examiners look for <strong>variety</strong> in structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple</li>
  <li>Compound</li>
  <li>Complex</li>
  <li>Compound–Complex</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>8. Example: Linked C1 Paragraphs in Full</h2>

<h3>Paragraph 1 (advantages):</h3>
<div class="example">
<p>
It is clear that modern technology has simplified many aspects of life. Daily tasks such as shopping,
banking, and studying can now be completed online in minutes. This increased efficiency saves time and
allows people to focus on other priorities. In addition, technology supports accessibility by helping
those with disabilities to work or communicate more easily.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Link to Paragraph 2:</strong><br>
Nevertheless, convenience often comes at a psychological cost.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 2 (disadvantages):</h3>
<div class="example">
<p>
Constant connectivity can lead to fatigue and distraction. For example, people frequently check their
phones even during conversations, which reduces attention and social quality. Moreover, the pressure to
be always available creates anxiety and disrupts rest. Therefore, while technology has made life faster,
it has also made it harder for people to disconnect.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>
In my view, technology has improved life overall, but individuals must learn to set boundaries.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Language of Balance and Nuance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>To some extent</strong>…</li>
  <li><strong>Although this may be the case</strong>…</li>
  <li><strong>It could be said that</strong>…</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>10. Common Paragraph Mistakes at C1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No clear topic sentence</li>
  <li>Too many ideas in one paragraph</li>
  <li>Repetition of connectors</li>
  <li>Overly long sentences</li>
  <li>Personal tone</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>11. Practice: Rewrite and Link</h2>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<div class="example">
<p>
People like using technology. They can work faster. It saves time. But they use phones too much.
It can make people stressed. They need to relax more.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Possible answer:</strong></p>

<div class="example">
<p>
Technology helps people work more efficiently and saves valuable time in daily life. Online tools, for
example, allow tasks that once took hours to be completed in seconds.
</p>
<p>
However, excessive use of technology can lead to stress. Many people spend too much time on their
phones, which reduces real rest and concentration. Therefore, balance is essential: technology should
serve people, not control them.
</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>12. Editing for Flow</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Does each paragraph have a clear focus?</li>
  <li>Do sentences flow naturally?</li>
  <li>Is there variety in structure?</li>
  <li>Does each paragraph connect logically to the next?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>13. Final Reflection</h2>

<p>
At C1 level, paragraphs are small journeys — each with direction, rhythm, and reflection.
</p>

<p>
<strong>B2 writers connect ideas.<br>
C1 writers connect thinking.</strong>
