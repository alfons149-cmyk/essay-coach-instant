      <h2>1. What Makes a C1 Paragraph Different</h2>

      <p>
        At B2 level, a good paragraph is one clear idea with a few supporting sentences.
        At C1 level, the same rule applies – but you need to go deeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        C1 paragraphs show:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance</strong> – they present an idea and acknowledge other perspectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong> – they include examples, explanations, and mini-conclusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety</strong> – they use a mix of sentence structures for rhythm.</li>
        <li><strong>Cohesion</strong> – ideas link smoothly to what comes before and after.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        In short: <strong>B2 paragraphs explain. C1 paragraphs explore.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Deep PEEL -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u15-deep-peel">
      <h2>2. Structure: The “Deep PEEL” Model</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, we expand the familiar <strong>PEEL</strong> model (Point – Evidence – Explain – Link)
        into a more flexible C1 version.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>The Deep PEEL model</h3>
        <ul class="breakdown-list">
          <li>
            <strong>P – Point:</strong> Introduce the main idea clearly.<br>
            <span class="example">Job satisfaction improves motivation.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E – Evidence:</strong> Add support (example, fact, or situation).<br>
            <span class="example">For example, people who enjoy their work often perform better.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E – Explain:</strong> Show <em>why</em> the idea is true or important.<br>
            <span class="example">This is because enjoyment increases creativity and persistence.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>L – Link:</strong> Connect to the essay’s main question or next paragraph.<br>
            <span class="example">Nevertheless, not everyone has the luxury of choosing a job they love.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E² – Evaluate (C1 extension):</strong> Offer a balanced or reflective comment.<br>
            <span class="example">Therefore, while satisfaction is desirable, stability may sometimes take priority.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        This final <strong>Evaluate</strong> stage is what examiners notice.
        It shows you can think critically, not just state facts.

      <h2>3. Example: Deep PEEL in Action</h2>

      <p>Let’s take a C1 topic: <strong>technology and convenience</strong>.</p>

      <article class="example-card">
        <h3>Sample C1 paragraph</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          One clear advantage of modern technology is that it has made communication faster and more
          convenient. For instance, online platforms allow people to stay in contact regardless of distance.
          This saves both time and money, making it easier to maintain friendships or work relationships.
          However, this constant availability can also increase stress, as people feel pressure to respond
          immediately. Overall, while technology has improved communication, it has also blurred the line
          between work and personal life.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It begins clearly (Point).</li>
        <li>It gives examples (Evidence).</li>
        <li>It shows understanding of both sides (Explanation + Balance).</li>
        <li>It ends with a reflective evaluation (Evaluation).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is what examiners mean when they write:
        <em>“shows awareness of complexity.”</em>

      <h2>4. Linking Within a Paragraph</h2>

      <p>
        At C1, sentences must flow naturally. That means connecting ideas with a light touch – not with
        mechanical connectors in every sentence.
      </p>

      <p>Here are several techniques.</p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.1 Logical connectors (subtle and natural)</h3>
        <p>Use them sparingly and purposefully.</p>

        <table class="structure-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Function</th>

            <tr>
              <td>Addition</td>
              <td>moreover, in addition, what is more</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Contrast</td>
              <td>however, nevertheless, yet, whereas</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Cause / Result</td>
              <td>therefore, thus, consequently, as a result</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Example</td>
              <td>for instance, for example, such as</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Emphasis</td>
              <td>indeed, in fact, above all, particularly</td>

        <p class="example">
          ✅ Online education has become more popular; moreover, it offers flexibility that traditional
          classes cannot provide.

          ✅ Some argue that technology isolates people; nevertheless, it also enables new forms of connection.

        <h3>4.2 Reference words</h3>
        <p>
          Pronouns and determiners create smooth internal flow.
        </p>

          Technology has changed daily life. <strong>This</strong> change affects how people work,
          communicate, and relax.

          Governments are investing in renewable energy. <strong>Such</strong> initiatives are essential
          for the future.

          These small words replace repetition and connect ideas elegantly.

      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.3 Thematic repetition</h3>
        <p>
          Reusing key words or synonyms keeps unity:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Education improves opportunities. A strong education system helps people escape poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use variation, not mechanical repetition:
          <br><strong>education</strong> → <em>learning, schooling, academic development</em>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.4 Sentence variety</h3>
        <p>
          C1 writing flows when sentence lengths and types vary.
          Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, balanced ones.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Technology connects people. Yet it can also isolate them if overused.

          While communication has never been easier, many now struggle to disconnect from their screens.

      <p>
        Depth comes from <strong>explanation</strong> – the “why” behind your ideas.
        This is where “shallow” paragraphs become fully developed C1 paragraphs.

      <p>
        At C1, examiners look for <strong>variety in sentence structure</strong>.

      <p>Here are some patterns to practise when building paragraphs:</p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Simple:</strong> People value job security.</li>
        <li><strong>Compound:</strong> People value job security, and they also seek satisfaction.</li>

        <li><strong>Compound–complex:</strong> Although job security is essential, satisfaction often leads to higher productivity, and many employees now look for both.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Try to include at least one <strong>complex sentence</strong> per paragraph.
        It shows grammatical control and natural sophistication.

        Advanced writing is not about using more words – it is about using the right ones in the
        right place.

      <h2>11. Practice: Rewrite and Link</h2>

      <p><strong>Exercise:</strong></p>
      <p>Rewrite this text into two well-linked paragraphs:</p>

      <p class="example"><em>
        People like using technology. They can work faster. It saves time. But they use phones too much.
        It can make people stressed. They need to relax more.
      </em></p>

      <p><strong>✅ Possible answer:</strong></p>
      <p class="example"><em>
        Technology helps people work more efficiently and saves valuable time in daily life. Online tools,
        for example, allow tasks that once took hours to be completed in seconds.
      </em></p>
      <p class="example"><em>
        However, excessive use of technology can lead to stress. Many people spend too much time on their
        phones, which reduces real rest and concentration. Therefore, balance is essential: technology
        should serve people, not control them.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        Notice how short, broken ideas turn into smooth, developed paragraphs with clear linking.

      <h2>12. Editing for Flow</h2>

      <p>
        When editing your C1 paragraphs, ask:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Does each paragraph have a clear focus?</li>
        <li>Do sentences flow naturally, not mechanically?</li>
        <li>Is there a variety of structure and rhythm?</li>
        <li>Does every paragraph connect logically to the next?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you can answer “yes”, your writing already sounds advanced.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u15-final">
      <h2>13. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        At the C1 level, paragraphs are no longer simple containers of ideas.
        They are small journeys – each with direction, rhythm, and reflection.
      </p>

      <p>When you write:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build paragraphs around one clear, deep idea.</li>
        <li>Connect them smoothly, not mechanically.</li>
        <li>Let each one lead naturally to the next.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The reader should feel guided, not dragged.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: <strong>B2 writers connect ideas. C1 writers connect thinking.</strong><br>
        That is the difference between being understood and being respected as a writer.
      </p>
