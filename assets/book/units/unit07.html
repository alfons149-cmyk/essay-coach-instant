<h2>Unit 7: Building Strong Paragraphs</h2>

<p>
  So far, you have learned how to build clear, accurate and stylish sentences. Now it’s time to put
  those sentences to work together. In this unit, you’ll learn how to build <strong>strong paragraphs</strong>:
  clear, focused blocks of meaning that carry your argument step by step through the essay.
</p>

<p>
  Cambridge examiners do not only read individual sentences. They read paragraphs and ask:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there one clear main idea?</li>
  <li>Do the sentences support that idea logically?</li>
  <li>Is the order natural and easy to follow?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When your paragraphs are strong, your whole essay becomes easier to read – and easier to give a
  higher band.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. What Is a Paragraph (in a Cambridge Essay)?</h3>

<p>
  In exam writing, a paragraph is more than a block of text. It is a small unit of meaning with one
  clear <strong>job</strong>. Typically, a Cambridge essay paragraph:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>has one main idea (the “topic” of the paragraph)</li>
  <li>starts with a sentence that introduces that idea</li>
  <li>continues with sentences that explain, develop or give examples</li>
  <li>often ends with a sentence that wraps up or connects forward</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Think of each paragraph as a mini-essay inside your essay: beginning, middle, and end.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Role of Each Paragraph</h3>

<p>
  Most Cambridge essays at B2–C2 follow this basic shape:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Introduction</strong> – shows the topic and your overall position.</li>
  <li><strong>Body paragraph 1</strong> – develops one main reason, argument, or aspect.</li>
  <li><strong>Body paragraph 2</strong> – develops a contrasting or complementary point.</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> – sums up and gives your final view.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Longer tasks (C1/C2) can include a third body paragraph, but the principle is the same: each
  paragraph has a clear role in the bigger structure of the essay.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Topic Sentence – The Paragraph’s “Headline”</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>topic sentence</strong> is usually the first sentence in a body paragraph. It:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduces the main idea of the paragraph</li>
  <li>sets the direction for the sentences that follow</li>
  <li>acts as a “promise” to the reader</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weak topic sentence</strong></p>

<p><em>There are many things to say about technology.</em></p>

<p>
  This is vague. The examiner doesn’t know which aspect you will focus on.
</p>

<p><strong>Stronger topic sentences</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>One clear benefit of modern technology is that it allows people to work flexibly from home.</em></li>
  <li><em>However, technology can also reduce face-to-face interaction, which is essential for building strong relationships.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now the examiner knows exactly what this paragraph will discuss.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Supporting Sentences – Develop, Don’t Just Repeat</h3>

<p>
  After your topic sentence, you need <strong>supporting sentences</strong>. These:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain the idea in more detail</li>
  <li>give reasons, examples, or consequences</li>
  <li>show cause and effect, contrast, or results</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example paragraph</strong></p>

<p><em>
  One clear benefit of modern technology is that it allows people to work flexibly from home.
  This flexibility is particularly valuable for parents or people who live far away from the office.
  For instance, many companies now offer remote positions that employees can do from any location
  with an internet connection. As a result, workers can save time and money on commuting, and they
  often feel less stressed.
</em></p>

<p>Notice how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sentence 1 = topic sentence</li>
  <li>sentences 2–4 = development + example + result</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The whole paragraph is about <em>flexible work from home</em>, not everything about technology.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Order Inside the Paragraph – Logical Sequencing</h3>

<p>
  Even if each sentence is correct, you still need a logical order.
  Common patterns for body paragraphs include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General → reason → example → result</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Point → explanation → example → mini-conclusion</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Problem → cause → consequence → possible solution</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example: problem → cause → consequence</strong></p>

<p><em>
  One major problem in many cities is traffic congestion. This often happens because public
  transport is unreliable or too expensive for many people. As a consequence, most commuters prefer
  to drive, which increases pollution and makes journeys even slower. Without significant investment
  in public transport, this situation is unlikely to improve.
</em></p>

<p>
  The reader can clearly follow the logic from problem to cause to consequence to prediction.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Linking Sentences Inside the Paragraph</h3>

<p>
  To create flow, use <strong>linking words and phrases</strong> inside the paragraph, not only between
  paragraphs. For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adding ideas:</strong> furthermore, in addition, moreover, what is more</li>
  <li><strong>Giving examples:</strong> for example, for instance, such as, in particular</li>
  <li><strong>Showing result:</strong> therefore, as a result, consequently, thus</li>
  <li><strong>Contrasting:</strong> however, on the other hand, in contrast, nevertheless</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example with linking words</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Studying abroad has several advantages. <strong>For example,</strong> students are exposed to new
  cultures and ways of thinking. <strong>In addition,</strong> they often become more independent, as they
  have to manage their own finances and daily life. <strong>As a result,</strong> many students return home
  more mature and confident.
</em></p>

<p>
  These small phrases act like bridges between sentences, guiding the reader through your ideas.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Linking Paragraphs to Each Other</h3>

<p>
  Paragraphs should not feel like separate islands. Use **bridging sentences** or **linking phrases**
  to connect one paragraph to the next.
</p>

<p><strong>Example – end of paragraph 1:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Online learning can make education more accessible to people who live far from schools or have
  full-time jobs. However, it also has several disadvantages that we should consider.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Beginning of paragraph 2:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  One major disadvantage is the lack of face-to-face interaction, which can make students feel
  isolated.
</em></p>

<p>
  The word <em>However</em> and the phrase <em>one major disadvantage</em> clearly show that you are now
  moving from advantages to disadvantages.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Paragraph Unity – One Main Job Only</h3>

<p>
  A strong paragraph has <strong>unity</strong>: everything inside it supports one main idea. If you add a
  sentence that doesn’t fit, the paragraph becomes confusing.
</p>

<p><strong>Unfocused paragraph</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Social media can help people stay in contact with friends who live abroad. Many young people also
  use social media to follow celebrities. Some teenagers do not get enough sleep, which affects
  their performance at school.
</em></p>

<p>
  The last sentence introduces a new topic (sleep), so it should belong in a different paragraph.
</p>

<p><strong>Improved version</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Social media can help people stay in contact with friends who live abroad. Many young people also
  use it to follow celebrities and share their interests with others. As a result, they may feel
  more connected to a global community.
</em></p>

<p>
  Now all the sentences point in the same direction: staying connected through social media.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Paragraph Coherence – Making It Easy to Follow</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Coherence</strong> means that your ideas are not only related, but also easy to follow. To make a
  paragraph coherent, use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reference words</strong> – this, these, such, it, they</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition with variation</strong> – repeating key nouns with small changes</li>
  <li><strong>Logical connectors</strong> – as mentioned, for this reason, in contrast, overall</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Group work can be extremely beneficial for students. <strong>This type of activity</strong> encourages them
  to share ideas and listen to different opinions. <strong>Such collaboration</strong> also helps them develop
  important skills for the workplace, <strong>where teamwork</strong> is increasingly valued.
</em></p>

<p>
  Notice how <em>this type of activity</em>, <em>such collaboration</em>, and <em>teamwork</em> all refer back to
  the same core idea: group work.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. The Mini-Conclusion of a Paragraph</h3>

<p>
  A good body paragraph often ends with a sentence that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>summarises the main point, or</li>
  <li>links to the next idea.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>For these reasons, working from home can greatly improve employees’ quality of life.</em></li>
  <li><em>Although online learning is convenient, it is important to recognise its limitations.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  This final sentence tells the examiner: “This paragraph is complete. I’m ready for the next one.”
</p>

<hr>

<h3>11. Practice: Repairing and Rebuilding Paragraphs</h3>

<p><strong>Task 1 – Identify the topic sentence</strong></p>

<p>Read this paragraph and underline the topic sentence:</p>

<p><em>
  Many students feel anxious before exams. They worry about disappointing their parents or teachers.
  Some also compare themselves to classmates, which makes them feel even worse. For this reason,
  schools should teach stress-management techniques and give more emotional support.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Task 2 – Add support</strong></p>

<p>Complete this paragraph with two or three supporting sentences of your own:</p>

<p><em>
  One major advantage of volunteering is that it allows young people to gain real-world experience.
</em></p>

<p>Think of: where they volunteer, what they learn, how it helps them in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Task 3 – Fix the unity</strong></p>

<p>Improve this paragraph by removing or changing the sentences that don’t belong.</p>

<p><em>
  Online shopping is becoming more popular every year. Many people enjoy visiting physical shops at
  the weekend. Some online shops offer free delivery and easy returns. My favourite subject at
  school is English. As a result, customers often buy more than they originally planned.
</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>12. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
  Strong paragraphs are the bridge between good sentences and a strong essay. When each paragraph
  has a clear role, a focused topic sentence, logical support, and a gentle “exit” sentence, your
  writing feels organised and confident.
</p>

<p><em>
  Remember: the examiner does not just read your sentences — they follow your journey, one paragraph
  at a time.
</em></p>

<p>
  In the next part of the course, we will put everything together: using your sentence skills and
  paragraph skills to write full Cambridge answers under time pressure.
