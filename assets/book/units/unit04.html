    <h1>Punctuation and Sentence Flow</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Once you can build clear sentences and connect them, the next step is to control how they
      <strong>sound</strong> on the page. This is where punctuation becomes powerful. It is not just about rules;
      it is about rhythm, clarity, and flow.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will look at how full stops, commas, semicolons, and other marks help your writing feel
      natural, precise, and easy to read – exactly what Cambridge examiners want.

    <!-- 1. Why Punctuation Matters -->
    <section id="u4-why-punctuation" class="unit-section">
      <h2 id="u4-punctuation">1. Why Punctuation Matters</h2>

      <p>Punctuation is to writing what pauses and intonation are to speaking.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Without punctuation:</strong></p>
        <p>
          students who understand punctuation write more clearly they make fewer mistakes and their teachers
          can follow their ideas more easily
        </p>

        <p><strong>With punctuation:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Students who understand punctuation write more clearly. They make fewer mistakes, and their teachers
          can follow their ideas more easily.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The words are almost the same, but the effect is completely different. Punctuation helps the reader
        “hear” your ideas in their head.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Good punctuation does three things:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>shows where one sentence ends and the next begins,</li>
        <li>groups words that belong together,</li>
        <li>creates a natural rhythm for the reader.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Full Stops and Sentence Boundaries -->
    <section id="u4-full-stops" class="unit-section">
      <h2 id="u4-full-stops-heading">2. Full Stops and Sentence Boundaries</h2>

      <p>
        A full stop <strong>(.)</strong> marks the end of a complete idea – one independent clause or a group of clauses
        that belong together.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong></p>
        <p>Many teenagers use social media every day. However, they are not always aware of its risks.</p>

        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
        <p>Many teenagers use social media every day however they are not always aware of its risks.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In Cambridge writing, a very common problem is the <strong>run-on sentence</strong> – when two complete sentences
        are pushed together with no punctuation or only a comma.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Run-on:</strong></p>
        <p>Technology makes life easier it also creates new problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Comma splice:</strong></p>
        <p>Technology makes life easier, it also creates new problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Better:</strong></p>
        <p>Technology makes life easier, but it also creates new problems.</p>
        <p>Technology makes life easier. It also creates new problems.</p>
        <p>Technology makes life easier; however, it also creates new problems.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        At B2 and C1 level, avoiding run-ons and comma splices already makes your writing look more advanced.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Commas: Pauses, Lists, and Clauses -->
    <section id="u4-commas" class="unit-section">
      <h2 id="u4-commas-heading">3. Commas: Pauses, Lists, and Clauses</h2>

      <p>Commas are the most common punctuation mark – and the most misused.</p>

      <h3 id="u4-lists">3.1 Commas in lists</h3>

      <p>Use commas to separate items in a list of three or more.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Students need time, good materials, and consistent practice.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3.2 Commas with introductory phrases</h3>

      <p>
        When you start a sentence with a time phrase, dependent clause, or linking phrase, you usually need a comma.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>In recent years, online courses have become more popular.</p>
        <p>Although it is convenient, online learning can feel isolating.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, traditional classes offer face-to-face contact.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3.3 Commas with extra information (non-defining clauses)</h3>

      <p>
        Use commas to separate extra information that is <strong>not essential</strong> to identify the noun. If you
        remove the extra part, the main meaning is still clear.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>My brother, who lives in London, is studying engineering.</p>
        <p>My brother is studying engineering. (main idea still clear)</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When the information is essential (defining), you usually <strong>do not</strong> use commas:
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Defining:</strong></p>
        <p>Students who read regularly often write better essays.</p>
        <p>(Not all students – only the ones who read regularly.)</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3.4 Commas with coordinating conjunctions</h3>

      <p>
        When you join two independent clauses with <em>and, but, or, so, yet</em>, use a comma before the connector.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong></p>
        <p>The film was long, but it was very interesting.</p>

        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
        <p>The film was long but it was very interesting. (often acceptable in informal writing, but weaker in exams)</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Semicolons and Colons -->
    <section id="u4-semicolons-colons" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Semicolons and Colons</h2>

      <p>Semicolons and colons are advanced tools. Used carefully, they give your writing a C1–C2 feel.</p>

      <h3>4.1 Semicolons (;)</h3>

      <p>
        A semicolon links two closely related sentences. It is stronger than a comma but softer than a full stop.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>Many people support online learning; others still prefer traditional classrooms.</p>
        <p>The city is noisy during the day; at night, it becomes surprisingly quiet.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Semicolons are also used before conjunctive adverbs such as <em>however, therefore, moreover</em>:
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>We planned the project carefully; however, the results were disappointing.</p>
        <p>He did not study for the exam; therefore, his mark was low.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>4.2 Colons (:)</h3>

      <p>
        A colon introduces an explanation, list, or example that follows directly from the previous idea.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>Students need three things to improve their writing: time, feedback, and practice.</p>
        <p>There is one main reason why I support public transport: it reduces traffic and pollution.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In essays, a well-placed colon can highlight a key point and make your argument clearer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Punctuation and Sentence Flow -->
    <section id="u4-flow" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Punctuation and Sentence Flow</h2>

      <p>
        Punctuation is not only about correctness; it also shapes the <strong>music</strong> of your writing – where it
        speeds up, slows down, or pauses.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Flat version:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Modern life is stressful and many people feel tired after work and they do not have time to relax or see their
          friends which affects their wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Improved version:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Modern life is stressful. Many people feel tired after work, and they do not have time to relax or see their
          friends, which affects their wellbeing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the improved version, full stops and commas guide the reader through shorter, clearer units of meaning. The
        sentence still feels connected, but it is no longer heavy.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Simple rule for flow:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use full stops to cut very long sentences into manageable pieces.</li>
        <li>Use commas to group related ideas inside a sentence.</li>
        <li>Use semicolons occasionally to show a strong link between two ideas.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 6. Common Punctuation Mistakes -->
    <section id="u4-mistakes" class="unit-section">
      <h2>6. Common Punctuation Mistakes</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Comma splices</h3>

      <p>❌ <em>People read less nowadays, this is a serious problem.</em></p>
      <p>✅ <em>People read less nowadays, and this is a serious problem.</em></p>
      <p>✅ <em>People read less nowadays. This is a serious problem.</em></p>

      <h3>6.2 Missing commas after introductory clauses</h3>

      <p>❌ <em>When students are tired they find it hard to concentrate.</em></p>
      <p>✅ <em>When students are tired, they find it hard to concentrate.</em></p>

      <h3>6.3 Overusing commas</h3>

      <p>❌ <em>The internet, is very useful, for students.</em></p>
      <p>✅ <em>The internet is very useful for students.</em></p>

      <h3>6.4 No full stops</h3>

      <p>❌ <em>Many teenagers use social media every day and they spend hours online and they do not sleep enough</em></p>
      <p>✅ <em>Many teenagers use social media every day, and they spend hours online. As a result, they do not sleep enough.</em></p>

      <h3 id="u4-capital-letters">6.5 Capital letters</h3>

      <p>
        Capital letters are also part of punctuation. Use them to start every sentence and for proper nouns
        (names of people, places, organisations, languages, etc.).
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong></p>
        <p>Last year I visited London with my friend Maria.</p>

        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
        <p>last year i visited london with my friend maria.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In Cambridge exams, frequent capital-letter mistakes make your writing look less accurate, even if your ideas are strong.

      <h2>8. Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Punctuation is not decoration. It is a practical tool that helps your reader follow your ideas without
        effort. When you use full stops, commas, semicolons, and colons with confidence, your writing feels calm,
        clear, and controlled – even when your ideas are complex.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this unit, you have seen how punctuation shapes sentence boundaries, groups information, and supports
        natural rhythm. In the next units, we will continue to build on this foundation and use these tools to
        organise full paragraphs and, later, complete exam tasks.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Good punctuation is invisible: the reader does not notice it, because everything simply makes sense.
