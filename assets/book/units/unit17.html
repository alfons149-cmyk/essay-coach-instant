      You have already learned how to write structured, logical, and naturally formal essays.
      Now it is time to <strong>polish</strong>.

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Editing at the C1 level is about much more than correcting grammar – it is about making
      every word <strong>earn its place</strong>. This is the stage where you turn an accurate
      essay into one that reads like fluent, elegant English.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Think of it this way: <em>Writing</em> shows what you know.
      <em>Editing</em> shows who you are as a writer.

      In this unit, you will explore how to refine your writing through practical strategies that
      make your sentences cleaner, sharper, and more professional.

    <!-- 1. Why editing matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-why-edit">
      <h2>1. Why Editing Matters Even More at C1</h2>

      <p>
        At B2, editing helps you fix mistakes.
        At C1, editing helps you <strong>clarify meaning</strong> and
        <strong>elevate tone</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners at this level already expect grammatical control. What impresses them now is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concise expression</strong> – no wasted words.</li>
        <li><strong>Varied structure</strong> – rhythm and balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision</strong> – vocabulary that fits the exact idea.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Editing is not about changing your message – it is about refining the delivery.
        Imagine polishing a diamond: you do not change the stone, but you reveal its brilliance.
      </p>

    <!-- 2. Three stages -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-stages">
      <h2>2. The Three Stages of Advanced Editing</h2>

      <p>
        Efficient C1 editing follows three levels:
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Structure level</strong> – does the essay flow logically?</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence level</strong> – do sentences sound fluent and balanced?</li>
        <li><strong>Word level</strong> – are vocabulary and tone precise, natural, and powerful?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the next sections, you will move through these levels one by one.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Structure level -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-structure">
      <h2>3. Structure Level: Flow and Logic</h2>

      <p>
        At the structure level, you are checking the
        <strong>architecture</strong> of your essay – how paragraphs connect and how ideas develop.
      </p>

      <p>Ask yourself:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do my paragraphs follow a logical order?</li>
        <li>Does each paragraph begin clearly and end naturally?</li>
        <li>Do I move smoothly between ideas?</li>
        <li>Does my conclusion reflect my introduction?</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example – Before vs After</h3>
        <p class="example"><strong>Before:</strong><br>
          <em>
            Technology helps people work faster. It is not always good, though. People spend too much
            time on devices. There are benefits too.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example"><strong>After editing:</strong><br>
          <em>
            Although technology enables people to work more efficiently, it can also lead to excessive
            screen time and distraction. Nevertheless, its advantages, such as convenience and access
            to information, remain significant.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there is balance, flow, and clarity. That is structural editing – shaping the movement of ideas.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-sentences">
      <h2>4. Sentence Level: Rhythm and Clarity</h2>

      <p>
        At sentence level, advanced editing means making each sentence feel smooth to read.
        There are three key goals:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variety</strong> – avoid all sentences sounding the same.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – no unnecessary words.</li>
        <li><strong>Rhythm</strong> – a balance of long and short sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u17-redundancy">
        <h3>4.1 Cut redundancy</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>In my opinion, I personally believe that it is true that technology can help people in their
          everyday daily lives.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>Technology helps people in their daily lives.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask: “Does this word add meaning or just fill space?” If not, remove it.
          Each sentence should carry its own weight.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u17-padding">
        <h3>4.2 Avoid “wordy padding”</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>Due to the fact that</em> → ✅ <em>because</em><br>
          ❌ <em>At this point in time</em> → ✅ <em>now</em><br>
          ❌ <em>In order to</em> → ✅ <em>to</em><br>
          ❌ <em>The reason why is that</em> → ✅ <em>because</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The more direct your sentence, the more confident it sounds.
          Cambridge examiners value conciseness – it shows control.

        <h3>4.3 Mix sentence lengths</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Modern education systems encourage collaboration and innovation through group projects and
          technology. Yet not all students benefit equally. Those who prefer individual learning may
          feel lost in such environments.
        </em></p>
        <p>
          This variation gives your writing rhythm – a hallmark of advanced English.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.4 Simplify long sentences</h3>

          for society, it should also be taken into account that others may not share this particular opinion.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>Many people see technology as beneficial, though others disagree.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Elegant simplicity wins every time. Remember: complexity in
          <strong>thought</strong>, not in <strong>length</strong>.

      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.5 Avoid repetition of structure</h3>
        <p>
          If every sentence starts the same way – <em>“Many people believe…”</em> – your writing feels mechanical.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Try alternatives such as:<br>
          <em>There is little doubt that…</em><br>
          <em>A common argument is that…</em><br>
          <em>It has been suggested that…</em><br>
          <em>While some argue that…</em>
        </p>

        Now you zoom in further – to the details that make writing shine.
        This is where you refine <strong>how</strong> you say things.

      <article class="definition-card">

      <p>
        C1 writing must sound consistent in voice – not formal in one line and casual in the next.

      <p class="example">
        ❌ <em>People should take care of their health. It’s super important!</em><br>

        Even at C1, some essays feel like lists of good ideas rather than one unified piece.
        Editing helps smooth those edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        After writing, read the start and end of each paragraph and ask:

        This is how you edit at the C1 level – not by writing more, but by writing better.

      <h2>12. The Mindset of an Advanced Editor</h2>

      <p>
        Editing well requires the right mindset. You must be both
        <strong>the writer</strong> and <strong>the reader</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When writing, your job is to express ideas.<br>
        When editing, your job is to serve the reader.
      </p>

      <p>Ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can my reader follow my logic easily?</li>
        <li>Would they need to reread any sentence?</li>
        <li>Does my essay sound balanced and confident?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If the answer is yes, you have reached the level of control C1 expects.

      <h2>13. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Editing for style and precision is where your writing becomes artful.
        It is the difference between “writing English” and “writing <em>in</em> English”.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you edit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You make your ideas shine.</li>
        <li>You sound confident, not complicated.</li>
        <li>You show mastery, not memorisation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: at B2, you show you can write. At C1, you show you can think.
        Through editing, you show you can <strong>refine</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mark of a great writer is not the first draft – it is the discipline to improve it.
        So next time you finish an essay, do not close your pen immediately. Read it aloud once,
        tighten three sentences, replace two weak words – and smile.
        You have just turned a good essay into a great one.
      </p>
