    <h1>Editing for Style and Precision</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      You have already learned how to write structured, logical, and naturally formal essays.
      Now it is time to polish.

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Editing at the C1 level is about much more than correcting grammar — it is about making
      <strong>every word earn its place</strong>.
      This is the stage where you turn an accurate essay into one that reads like fluent, elegant English.

      <h2>1. Why Editing Matters Even More at C1</h2>

      <p>
        At B2, editing helps you fix mistakes.  
        At C1, editing helps you <strong>clarify meaning and elevate tone</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners at this level already expect grammatical control.
        What impresses them now is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>concise expression</strong> — no wasted words,</li>
        <li><strong>varied structure</strong> — rhythm and balance,</li>
        <li><strong>precision</strong> — vocabulary that fits the exact idea.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Editing does not change your message — it refines the delivery.  
        Like polishing a diamond: you reveal its brilliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-three-stages">
      <h2>2. The Three Stages of Advanced Editing</h2>

      <p>Efficient C1 editing follows three levels:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Structure level</strong> — Does the essay flow logically?</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence level</strong> — Do sentences sound fluent and balanced?</li>
        <li><strong>Word level</strong> — Is vocabulary precise, natural, and powerful?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-structure">
      <h2>3. Structure Level: Flow and Logic</h2>

      <p>
        At this stage, you check the <strong>architecture</strong> of your essay — how ideas and
        paragraphs connect.
      </p>

      <p>Ask yourself:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do my paragraphs follow a logical order?</li>
        <li>Does each paragraph begin clearly and end naturally?</li>
        <li>Do I move smoothly from one idea to the next?</li>
        <li>Does my conclusion reflect my introduction?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Technology helps people work faster. It is not always good, though. People spend too much
          time on devices. There are benefits too.
        </p>

        <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Although technology enables people to work more efficiently, it can also lead to excessive
          screen time and distraction. Nevertheless, its advantages, such as convenience and access
          to information, remain significant.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now there is balance, flow, and clarity.  
        That is structural editing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-sentence">
      <h2>4. Sentence Level: Rhythm and Clarity</h2>

      <p>
        Advanced editing means making sentences feel smooth and controlled.
        Three key goals:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variety</strong> — avoid repetitive patterns,</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — remove unnecessary words,</li>
        <li><strong>Rhythm</strong> — balance long and short sentences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>(a) Cut redundancy</h3>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> In my opinion, I personally believe that it is true that technology can help people in their everyday daily lives.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology helps people in their daily lives.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Avoid “wordy padding”</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>❌</strong> due to the fact that → <strong>✅</strong> because</li>
        <li><strong>❌</strong> at this point in time → <strong>✅</strong> now</li>
        <li><strong>❌</strong> in order to → <strong>✅</strong> to</li>
        <li><strong>❌</strong> the reason why is that → <strong>✅</strong> because</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Conciseness shows confidence.</p>

      <h3>(c) Mix sentence lengths</h3>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          Modern education systems encourage collaboration and innovation through group projects and
          technology. Those who prefer individual learning may feel lost in such environments. Yet not
          all students benefit equally.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>(d) Simplify long sentences</h3>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> While it is important to note that many individuals consider technology to be beneficial for society, it should also be taken into account that others may not share this particular opinion.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Many people see technology as beneficial, though others disagree.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(e) Avoid repetition of structure</h3>

      <p>Use varied sentence openings:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There is little doubt that…</li>
        <li>A common argument is that…</li>
        <li>It has been suggested that…</li>
        <li>While some argue that…</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-word">
      <h2>5. Word Level: Precision and Power</h2>

      <h3>(a) Choose precise verbs</h3>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> People make progress in their studies when they work hard.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Students achieve progress through consistent effort.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Avoid vague nouns</h3>

      <p><strong>Vague:</strong> thing, stuff, problem<br>
        <strong>Precise:</strong> factor, challenge, concern
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> There are many problems with social media.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Social media presents several challenges, including privacy risks and misinformation.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(c) Replace “very + adjective”</h3>

      <p>
        very big → enormous<br>
        very important → crucial
      </p>

      <h3>(d) Eliminate filler words</h3>

      <p><strong>Remove:</strong> really, quite, just, actually, basically</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> This is actually quite a big problem.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> This is a significant problem.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(e) Replace repetition</h3>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> Technology helps people communicate. Technology is also useful for education.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology enhances communication and supports modern education.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-ten-word">
      <h2>6. Editing for Conciseness: The “Ten-Word Test”</h2>

      <p>Take a long sentence and reduce it by ten words — without losing meaning.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Original (21 words):</strong></p>
        <p>People who use social media frequently are often less focused and productive because they constantly check their notifications.</p>

        <p><strong>Edited (13 words):</strong></p>
        <p>Frequent social media users often lose focus due to constant notifications.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-style-consistency">
      <h2>7. Editing for Style Consistency</h2>

      <p>All sentences must match the same formal voice.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> People should take care of their health. It’s super important!</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Individuals should take greater responsibility for their health, as it is essential.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-academic-balance">
      <h2>8. Editing for Academic Balance</h2>

      <p>Avoid extremes. Use cautious, analytical phrasing.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌</strong> Technology has completely ruined real communication.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology has changed the way people communicate, sometimes reducing the quality of personal interaction.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-coherence">
      <h2>9. Editing for Coherence</h2>

      <p>Check that ideas connect smoothly.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Before:</strong> Education is important. Governments should invest more. Technology can help teachers. Students use phones too much.</p>
        <p><strong>After:</strong> Education plays a vital role in social progress, and governments should invest accordingly. While technology can support teachers, its misuse among students remains a concern.</p>

      <h2>11. Self-Editing in Practice</h2>

      <p>Let us practise together. Here is a paragraph before and after editing.</p>

      <p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          In the modern world, technology is something that most people use every day, and it helps
          with a lot of things, such as communication and learning, but sometimes it causes some
          problems as well, because people get addicted to it or depend on it too much.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          Technology plays an essential role in modern life, improving communication and access to
          information. However, overreliance on digital devices can lead to distraction and
          dependency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Shorter.</li>
        <li>Clearer.</li>
        <li>More formal.</li>
        <li>More precise.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is how you edit at the C1 level — not by writing more, but by writing better.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u17-final">
      <h2>12. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Advanced editing is not about decorating your essay. It is about removing what is unnecessary
        so that your best ideas become easy to see.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you edit for structure, you create flow. When you edit your sentences, you create rhythm.
        When you edit at word level, you create precision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, these three levels turn a good C1 essay into a piece of writing that feels deliberate,
        confident, and controlled — the kind of text examiners trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next part of the course, you will continue to apply these editing skills to different
        Cambridge tasks, so that polishing your writing becomes a natural habit, not a last-minute panic.
