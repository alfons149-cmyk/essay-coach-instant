<h2>Unit 17: Editing for Style and Precision</h2>

<p>
You’ve already learned how to write structured, logical, and naturally formal essays.
Now it’s time to polish.
</p>

<p>
Editing at the C1 level is about much more than correcting grammar — it's about making 
<strong>every word earn its place</strong>.
This is the stage where you turn an accurate essay into one that reads like fluent, elegant English.
</p>

<p><em>Writing shows what you know. Editing shows who you are as a writer.</em></p>

<h3>1. Why Editing Matters Even More at C1</h3>

<p>
At B2, editing helps you fix mistakes.  
At C1, editing helps you <strong>clarify meaning and elevate tone</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Cambridge examiners at this level already expect grammatical control.  
What impresses them now is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>concise expression</strong> — no wasted words</li>
  <li><strong>varied structure</strong> — rhythm and balance</li>
  <li><strong>precision</strong> — vocabulary that fits the exact idea</li>
</ul>

<p>
Editing doesn’t change your message — it refines the delivery.  
Like polishing a diamond: you reveal its brilliance.
</p>

<h3>2. The Three Stages of Advanced Editing</h3>

<p>Efficient C1 editing follows three levels:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Structure level</strong> — Does the essay flow logically?</li>
  <li><strong>Sentence level</strong> — Do sentences sound fluent and balanced?</li>
  <li><strong>Word level</strong> — Is vocabulary precise, natural, and powerful?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>3. Structure Level: Flow and Logic</h3>

<p>
At this stage, you check the <strong>architecture</strong> of your essay — how ideas and 
paragraphs connect.
</p>

<p>Ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do my paragraphs follow a logical order?</li>
  <li>Does each paragraph begin clearly and end naturally?</li>
  <li>Do I move smoothly from one idea to the next?</li>
  <li>Does my conclusion reflect my introduction?</li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Technology helps people work faster. It is not always good, though. People spend too much 
    time on devices. There are benefits too.
  </p>

  <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Although technology enables people to work more efficiently, it can also lead to excessive 
    screen time and distraction. Nevertheless, its advantages, such as convenience and access 
    to information, remain significant.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Now there’s balance, flow, and clarity.  
That’s structural editing.</p>

<h3>4. Sentence Level: Rhythm and Clarity</h3>

<p>
Advanced editing means making sentences feel smooth and controlled.
Three key goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Variety</strong> — avoid repetitive patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — remove unnecessary words</li>
  <li><strong>Rhythm</strong> — balance long and short sentences</li>
</ul>

<h4>(a) Cut redundancy</h4>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> In my opinion, I personally believe that it is true that technology can help people in their everyday daily lives.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology helps people in their daily lives.</p>
</div>

<h4>(b) Avoid “wordy padding”</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>❌</strong> due to the fact that → <strong>✅</strong> because</li>
  <li><strong>❌</strong> at this point in time → <strong>✅</strong> now</li>
  <li><strong>❌</strong> in order to → <strong>✅</strong> to</li>
  <li><strong>❌</strong> the reason why is that → <strong>✅</strong> because</li>
</ul>

<p>Conciseness shows confidence.</p>

<h4>(c) Mix sentence lengths</h4>

<div class="example-box">
  <p>
    Modern education systems encourage collaboration and innovation through group projects and 
    technology. Those who prefer individual learning may feel lost in such environments. Yet not 
    all students benefit equally.
  </p>
</div>

<h4>(d) Simplify long sentences</h4>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> While it is important to note that many individuals consider technology to be beneficial for society, it should also be taken into account that others may not share this particular opinion.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Many people see technology as beneficial, though others disagree.</p>
</div>

<h4>(e) Avoid repetition of structure</h4>

<p>Use varied sentence openings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is little doubt that…</li>
  <li>A common argument is that…</li>
  <li>It has been suggested that…</li>
  <li>While some argue that…</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>5. Word Level: Precision and Power</h3>

<h4>(a) Choose precise verbs</h4>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> People make progress in their studies when they work hard.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Students achieve progress through consistent effort.</p>
</div>

<h4>(b) Avoid vague nouns</h4>

<p><strong>Vague:</strong> thing, stuff, problem  
<br><strong>Precise:</strong> factor, challenge, concern</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> There are many problems with social media.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Social media presents several challenges, including privacy risks and misinformation.</p>
</div>

<h4>(c) Replace “very + adjective”</h4>

<p>very big → enormous  
<br>very important → crucial</p>

<h4>(d) Eliminate filler words</h4>

<p><strong>Remove:</strong> really, quite, just, actually, basically</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> This is actually quite a big problem.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> This is a significant problem.</p>
</div>

<h4>(e) Replace repetition</h4>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> Technology helps people communicate. Technology is also useful for education.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology enhances communication and supports modern education.</p>
</div>

<h3>6. Editing for Conciseness: The “Ten-Word Test”</h3>

<p>Take a long sentence and reduce it by 10 words — without losing meaning.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Original (21 words):</strong></p>
  <p>People who use social media frequently are often less focused and productive because they constantly check their notifications.</p>

  <p><strong>Edited (13 words):</strong></p>
  <p>Frequent social media users often lose focus due to constant notifications.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>7. Editing for Style Consistency</h3>

<p>All sentences must match the same formal voice.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> People should take care of their health. It’s super important!</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Individuals should take greater responsibility for their health, as it is essential.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>8. Editing for Academic Balance</h3>

<p>Avoid extremes. Use cautious, analytical phrasing.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌</strong> Technology has completely ruined real communication.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Technology has changed the way people communicate, sometimes reducing the quality of personal interaction.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>9. Editing for Coherence</h3>

<p>Check that ideas connect smoothly.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Before:</strong> Education is important. Governments should invest more. Technology can help teachers. Students use phones too much.</p>
  <p><strong>After:</strong> Education plays a vital role in social progress, and governments should invest accordingly. While technology can support teachers, its misuse among students remains a concern.</p>
</div>
