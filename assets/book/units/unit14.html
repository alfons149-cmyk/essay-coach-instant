      By now, you already understand what the C1 essay task looks like. You know that you read two short
      texts, discuss both, and give your own opinion.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      But there is one thing that separates strong C1 writers from average ones:
      <strong>planning</strong>.
      At this level, planning is not just about listing ideas. It is about
      <strong>structuring thought</strong> – deciding what to include, what to leave out, and how to guide
      the reader through a logical, elegant argument.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will follow a simple plan:

    <ul class="unit-intro-list">
      <li>First, understand why planning matters <strong>even more</strong> at C1.</li>
      <li>Second, learn how to <strong>read, interpret, and break down</strong> the source texts.</li>
      <li>Third, build a <strong>balanced outline</strong> and develop ideas with depth and evaluation.</li>
      <li>Finally, create routines (idea banks, quick checks) that make planning fast and reliable in the exam.</li>

    <!-- 1. Why planning matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-plan">
      <h2>1. Why Planning Matters Even More at C1</h2>

      <p>
        At B2 level, planning helps you avoid mistakes and repetition.
        At C1, it does something more profound: it shows <strong>critical thinking</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners expect more than clear writing – they want <strong>reasoned writing</strong>.
        A well-planned essay shows that you can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>analyse different viewpoints,</li>
        <li>choose your own position,</li>
        <li>and express your reasoning with flow and confidence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Without planning, your ideas can feel unbalanced – too much on one side, not enough on the other.
        With a plan, every paragraph has a purpose.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: <strong>B2 planning organises ideas. C1 planning organises thinking.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Understanding source texts -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-source-texts">
      <h2>2. Understanding the Source Texts</h2>

      <p>
        Before you plan, you must understand what the input texts actually say.
        Let’s look again at a sample task:
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Sample C1 task</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          You have been discussing the impact of technology on daily life.<br>
          Below are some opinions:
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          “Technology has made life more convenient.”<br>
          “Technology has created more problems than it has solved.”
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Write an essay discussing both opinions and give your own view.<br>
          (220–260 words)
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        At C1 level, this is not just about listing advantages and disadvantages. You must
        <strong>interpret</strong> what each opinion means.
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li>
          <strong>“Technology has made life more convenient.”</strong><br>
          Focuses on comfort, access, and speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Technology has created more problems than it has solved.”</strong><br>
          Suggests side effects such as stress, inequality, or privacy issues.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once you see what each idea <strong>really means</strong>, your essay becomes more thoughtful.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Break down the question -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-break-question">
      <h2>3. Step One: Break Down the Question</h2>

      <p>
        Before you brainstorm, ask yourself three key questions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>What is the topic?</strong> → Technology in daily life.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>What are the two given opinions?</strong><br>
          (a) Technology = convenience.<br>
          (b) Technology = problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What is my task?</strong> → Discuss both and give my view.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now your brain knows exactly what it is dealing with.
        Everything you write must connect to those three answers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Brainstorm with purpose -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-brainstorm">
      <h2>4. Step Two: Brainstorm Ideas (with Purpose)</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, brainstorming is not just “writing everything you can think of.”
        It is choosing ideas that show insight.
      </p>

      <p>Make two short lists – one for each opinion:</p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Opinion 1 – “Technology has made life more convenient.”</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Communication is faster (emails, calls, AI tools).</li>
          <li>Access to information and education.</li>
          <li>Health apps and smart devices help people stay fit.</li>
          <li>Online shopping saves time.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Opinion 2 – “Technology has created more problems.”</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>People become too dependent on devices.</li>
          <li>Data privacy issues, online scams.</li>
          <li>Social isolation and stress from constant connection.</li>
          <li>Environmental impact (e-waste, energy use).</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        Now choose one or two ideas from each column that you can <strong>develop clearly</strong>.
        Quality is more important than quantity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Choose opinion -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-opinion">
      <h2>5. Step Three: Choose Your Opinion</h2>

      <p>
        At the end of your essay, you must state your own view.
        The best opinions are <strong>balanced</strong>, not extreme.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u14-evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation, not just description</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Although technology can create new challenges, its benefits to communication and daily life
          clearly outweigh the disadvantages.
        </em></p>
        <p>
          This kind of nuanced opinion sounds mature and earns higher marks. It shows you can see both sides
          before reaching a conclusion – this is <strong>evaluation</strong>, not just description.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Outline -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-outline">
      <h2>6. Step Four: Create a Logical Outline</h2>

      <p>
        Once you have chosen your key ideas, turn them into a quick plan.
        Here is a typical C1 essay outline:
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Outline example – Technology in daily life</h3>
        <ul class="breakdown-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Topic:</strong> Technology in daily life
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opinion:</strong> More advantages than problems, but some issues remain.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce topic and both views.<br>
            <span class="example">Technology influences every part of modern life; people disagree on its overall effect.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Body paragraph 1:</strong> Discuss “more convenient”.<br>
            <span class="example">Communication, access to information, education benefits – e.g. online courses.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Body paragraph 2:</strong> Discuss “creates problems”.<br>
            <span class="example">Overuse, mental health, privacy issues – e.g. social media stress.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Give your own view.<br>
            <span class="example">Benefits outweigh drawbacks, but people must use tech responsibly.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        That is your essay in blueprint form. You have already decided what to say – now writing it will be
        smooth and fast.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Develop depth -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-depth">
      <h2>7. Step Five: Develop Each Idea with Depth</h2>

      <p>
        At C1 level, a good essay goes beyond <strong>stating</strong> ideas. You must <strong>develop</strong> them.
        Think of your paragraphs as small arguments – each one should have a beginning, middle, and end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the <strong>PEEL</strong> model you already know, but add one more layer: <strong>evaluation</strong>.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>PEEL + Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>P – Point:</strong> State the main idea.<br>
            <span class="example">Technology has made communication easier.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>E – Example / Evidence:</strong> Give a concrete example.<br>
            <span class="example">For instance, video calls allow families to stay connected across the world.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>E – Explain:</strong> Show why this matters.<br>
            <span class="example">This saves time and reduces loneliness, making daily life more comfortable.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>L – Link:</strong> Connect to the next idea or opinion.<br>
            <span class="example">However, not everyone sees technology as positive; some believe it has caused more harm than good.</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Add a reflective thought.<br>
            <span class="example">Overall, convenience seems undeniable, though it depends on responsible use.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        This final step – evaluation – transforms your writing from B2 to C1.
        It shows that you can think, not just describe.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-connectors">
      <h2>8. Step Six: Plan Your Connectors and Transitions</h2>

      <p>
        At C1, smooth flow matters as much as good ideas.
        Your plan should include the transitions you will use between paragraphs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At B2, you usually discuss one idea per paragraph.
        At C1, you can be more flexible. You can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>dedicate one paragraph to each opinion, or</li>
        <li>combine both in a comparative paragraph.</li>

      <h2>10. Step Eight: Use the “Balance Scale” Method</h2>

      <p>
        Here is a mental image that helps advanced writers keep balance:
        imagine your essay as a <strong>scale</strong> – each side represents one opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job is to make sure the scale feels balanced throughout.
        You can lean slightly to one side (your final opinion), but not so heavily that the other side
        disappears.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example of imbalance</h3>
        <p class="example">

          Paragraph 2 = 30 words
        </p>
        <p>
          Examiners will mark that down for poor organisation. Aim for roughly equal length in your
          two main paragraphs.
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>

      <h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        At C1 level, a good essay is not about <strong>how much</strong> you know –
        it is about <strong>how clearly</strong> you can show it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Planning gives you that clarity. It turns your thoughts into structure, your structure into flow,
        and your flow into confidence.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You write faster.</li>
        <li>You sound more intelligent.</li>
        <li>You stay calm.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: <strong>Good writers think before they write.<br>
        Great writers think while they plan.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
