    <h1>Planning and Developing C1 Essays</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      By now, you already understand what the C1 essay task looks like. You know that you read two short
      texts, discuss both, and give your own opinion.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      But there is one thing that separates strong C1 writers from average ones:
      <strong>planning as structured thinking</strong>. At this level, planning is no longer just listing ideas.
      It is about <strong>structuring thought</strong> – deciding what to include, what to leave out, and how to guide
      the reader through a logical, elegant argument.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      This unit will show you how to plan and develop your essay so that your writing feels intelligent,
      calm, and controlled from start to finish.

      <h2>1. Why Planning Matters Even More at C1</h2>

      <p>
        At B2 level, planning helps you avoid repetition and simple mistakes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At C1, it does something deeper: it shows <strong>critical thinking</strong>.
        Cambridge examiners want more than clear writing – they want
        <strong>reasoned writing</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>A well-planned C1 essay shows that you can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>analyse different viewpoints,</li>
        <li>choose your own position,</li>
        <li>and express your reasoning with flow and confidence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Without planning, your ideas can feel unbalanced: too much on one side, not enough on the other.  
        With a plan, every paragraph has a job.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
        B2 planning organises ideas.<br>
        <strong>C1 planning organises thinking.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-source">
      <h2>2. Understanding the Source Texts</h2>

      <p>
        Before you plan, you must understand what the input texts actually say.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Sample task:</strong></p>
        <p><em>
          You have been discussing the impact of technology on daily life.  
          Below are some opinions:
        </em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Technology has made life more convenient.”</li>
          <li>“Technology has created more problems than it has solved.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>
          Write an essay discussing both opinions and give your own view.  
          (220–260 words)
        </em></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        At C1, this is not just a list of advantages and disadvantages.  
        You need to <strong>interpret</strong> what each opinion implies.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>“Technology has made life more convenient.”</em> → focuses on comfort, access, speed,
          communication, information, and efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>“Technology has created more problems than it has solved.”</em> → points to side effects
          such as stress, inequality, dependence, or privacy issues.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once you see what each idea really means, your plan – and your essay – become more thoughtful.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step1">
      <h2>3. Step One: Break Down the Question</h2>

      <p>Before you brainstorm, ask yourself three simple questions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>What is the topic?</strong><br>
          Technology in daily life.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What are the two given opinions?</strong><br>
          (a) Technology makes life more convenient.<br>
          (b) Technology creates more problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What is my task?</strong><br>
          Discuss both opinions and give my own view.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Now your brain knows exactly what it is dealing with.  
        Everything you write must connect to those three answers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step2">
      <h2>4. Step Two: Brainstorm Ideas (with Purpose)</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, brainstorming is not about writing down every idea you can think of.
        It’s about choosing ideas that show insight.
      </p>

      <table class="compare">
        <tr>
          <th>Opinion 1: “Technology has made life more convenient.”</th>
          <th>Opinion 2: “Technology has created more problems.”</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Faster communication (emails, video calls, messaging apps).</li>
              <li>Easy access to information and education (online courses, tutorials).</li>
              <li>Health and fitness apps that support lifestyle changes.</li>
              <li>Online banking and shopping save time and effort.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Dependence on devices; constant distraction.</li>
              <li>Data privacy issues, online scams, tracking.</li>
              <li>Social isolation, stress, and comparison via social media.</li>
              <li>Environmental impact: e-waste, energy consumption.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Now choose one or two ideas from each side that you can
        <strong>develop clearly</strong>.  
        At C1, quality is more important than quantity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step3">
      <h2>5. Step Three: Choose Your Opinion</h2>

      <p>
        At the end of your essay, you must give a personal view.  
        The strongest C1 opinions are usually <strong>balanced</strong>, not extreme.
      </p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Technology brings more advantages than problems, but only if it is used responsibly.”</li>
        <li>“Technology creates serious problems, yet it is still essential for progress.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This kind of nuanced opinion sounds mature and earns higher marks.  
        It shows that you can see both sides before reaching a conclusion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step4">
      <h2>6. Step Four: Create a Logical Outline</h2>

      <p>
        Once you have your ideas and your overall view, turn them into a quick outline.  
        Here is a typical C1 structure for our sample task:
      </p>

      <table class="structure">
        <tr>
          <th>Part</th>
          <th>Content</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Intro</td>
          <td>Introduce topic + both views</td>
          <td>
            Technology in daily life; some see it as convenient, others see it as harmful.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Body 1</td>
          <td>Discuss “more convenient”</td>
          <td>
            Communication, access to information, education.  
            Example: online learning, remote work.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Body 2</td>
          <td>Discuss “more problems”</td>
          <td>
            Overuse, mental health, privacy, dependence.  
            Example: social media stress, cybercrime.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Conclusion</td>
          <td>Give your own view</td>
          <td>
            Benefits outweigh drawbacks, but people and governments must use technology responsibly.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        That outline is your “blueprint”.  
        You have already decided what you are going to say – now the writing will be much smoother.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step5">
      <h2>7. Step Five: Develop Each Idea with Depth</h2>

      <p>
        At C1, you don’t just <em>state</em> ideas – you <strong>develop and evaluate</strong> them.
        Think of each paragraph as a small argument with a beginning, middle, and end.
      </p>

      <p>
        You already know the PEEL model. Here we add one more layer, <strong>Evaluation</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>P – Point:</strong> State the main idea.</li>
        <li><strong>E – Example / Evidence:</strong> Give a concrete example.</li>
        <li><strong>E – Explain:</strong> Show why it matters.</li>
        <li><strong>L – Link:</strong> Connect to the next idea or opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>+ Evaluation:</strong> Add a reflective thought or limitation.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example (C1 paragraph skeleton):</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Point:</strong> Technology has made communication significantly easier.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> For instance, video calls allow families in different countries to stay in touch every day.</p>
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong> This saves time and reduces feelings of isolation, making daily life more comfortable.</p>
        <p><strong>Link:</strong> However, not everyone sees these changes as entirely positive.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Overall, the convenience is undeniable, but it depends on using these tools in a balanced way.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        That final evaluation step is what really pushes your writing from B2 to C1.  
        It shows that you can think about your ideas, not just describe them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step6">
      <h2>8. Step Six: Plan Your Connectors and Transitions</h2>

      <p>
        At C1, <strong>flow</strong> is almost as important as content.  
        Your plan should already include some transitions between paragraphs.
      </p>

      <table class="connectors">
        <tr>
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Advanced connectors</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Adding</td>
          <td>furthermore, in addition, what is more</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Contrasting</td>
          <td>nevertheless, however, despite this, on the other hand</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Result</td>
          <td>consequently, as a result, thus, therefore</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Balancing</td>
          <td>while it is true that…, even though…, although…</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Summarising</td>
          <td>overall, in summary, to sum up</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Example transition plan:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Between intro and Body 1:</em> To begin with, many people argue that technology has made everyday life more convenient.</li>
        <li><em>Between Body 1 and Body 2:</em> Nevertheless, there is also a strong argument that technology has created new problems.</li>
        <li><em>Before the conclusion:</em> Overall, both sides have valid points, but…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need dozens of connectors. You need a few that you can use naturally and logically.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step7">
      <h2>9. Step Seven: Decide How to Integrate the Two Opinions</h2>

      <p>
        At B2, you usually keep ideas separate: one paragraph per point.  
        At C1, you have more flexibility. You can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>use a separate approach</strong>: one paragraph per opinion, or</li>
        <li><strong>use an integrated approach</strong>: compare both within the same paragraph.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Separate approach (clear and safe):</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Paragraph 1 – Opinion 1 (advantages)</li>
        <li>Paragraph 2 – Opinion 2 (problems)</li>
        <li>Conclusion – your view</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Integrated approach (more advanced):</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Paragraph 1 – Main advantage, with brief contrast</li>
        <li>Paragraph 2 – Main disadvantage, directly compared to the benefit</li>
        <li>Conclusion – your view</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Integrated sentence example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Technology has undoubtedly made communication faster and easier; however, this constant
          connectivity can also increase stress and reduce privacy. The same tool that connects us can,
          paradoxically, isolate us.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The integrated structure can sound very elegant, but it requires control.  
        Use it once you feel confident with the separate structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step8">
      <h2>10. Step Eight: Use the “Balance Scale” Method</h2>

      <p>
        Here is a useful mental image:  
        Imagine your essay as a <strong>scale</strong>. Each side represents one of the opinions.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your job is to keep the scale reasonably balanced while you write.</li>
        <li>You can lean slightly to one side (your final opinion), but you should not ignore the other side.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example of imbalance:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Paragraph 1 (Opinion 1): 80 words</li>
        <li>Paragraph 2 (Opinion 2): 30 words</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This makes the essay feel one-sided, and examiners will mark it down for weak organisation.
        Aim for roughly similar length and depth when discussing each opinion.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u14-step9">
      <h2>11. Step Nine: Build Your Own “Idea Bank”</h2>

      <p>
        Planning becomes much faster when you already have ideas for common C1 topics.
        Start a small notebook or digital file where you store 4–6 key ideas per theme.
      </p>

      <table class="structure">
        <tr>
          <th>Topic</th>
          <th>Typical idea bank notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Education</td>
          <td>equality, online learning, creativity vs exams, lifelong learning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Technology</td>
          <td>convenience, privacy, dependence, innovation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Environment</td>
          <td>personal responsibility, government policy, green energy</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Work</td>
          <td>job satisfaction, job security, work–life balance, automation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Health</td>
          <td>mental vs physical health, diet, stress, lifestyle</td>

          <td>Society</td>
          <td>social media, community, individualism, shared values</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Before each essay, you only need to adapt ideas from your bank to the specific question.  
        That preparation builds confidence – and speed.

      <h2>12. Step Ten: Review Your Plan Before Writing</h2>

      <p>
        Before you start your first sentence, pause for ten seconds and scan your plan.
        Ask yourself:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>✅ Do I understand both opinions?</li>
        <li>✅ Have I chosen a clear view?</li>
        <li>✅ Do my main paragraphs feel balanced?</li>
        <li>✅ Do I have connectors ready?</li>
        <li>✅ Can I reasonably stay within 220–260 words?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If the answer is yes, start writing.  
        Your hand will move more confidently because your brain already knows the path.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Overplanning</strong><br>
          Writing full sentences in your plan and losing time.<br>

      <h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        At C1 level, a good essay is not about <em>how much</em> you know – it is about
        <strong>how clearly you can show it</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Planning gives you that clarity. It turns your thoughts into structure, your structure into flow,
        and your flow into confidence.
      </p>

      <p>When you plan carefully:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>you write faster,</li>
        <li>you sound more intelligent,</li>
        <li>you stay calmer under time pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
        Good writers think before they write.  
        Great writers think while they plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, we continue with
        <strong>Unit 15: Writing and Linking C1 Paragraphs</strong>, where you’ll learn how to make each paragraph
        sound mature, connected, and stylistically advanced – using real examples, natural transitions,
        and sentence variety to reach true C1 fluency.
