<h2>Unit 6: Word Choice and Vocabulary Precision</h2>

<p>
  Once your sentences are structurally strong, the next step is to make them shine.
  In Cambridge exams, what separates a good essay from an excellent one is often not grammar,
  but <strong>word choice</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Choosing the right words is like choosing the right colours for a painting:  
  each has a shade, a tone, and an emotional effect. Some words are formal, some casual.
  Some precise, some vague. This unit helps you choose vocabulary that is accurate, controlled,
  and naturally suited to Cambridge-style writing.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. Why Word Choice Matters</h3>

<p>Compare these two versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>People are very angry about the situation.</em></li>
  <li><em>People are furious about the situation.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both are correct — but the second sounds more natural, powerful, and advanced.
  Cambridge examiners often write comments like:
</p>

<p class="quote">“Good control of vocabulary but limited range.”</p>

<p>
  This means your words are right, but not rich enough.  
  To reach C1–C2, you need <strong>range</strong> and <strong>precision</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Rule One: Avoid “Very” (and Weak Intensifiers)</h3>

<p>
  Students often use “very” when they don’t know a stronger word.
  But “very” actually weakens your writing because it shows uncertainty.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Instead of “very…”</th><th>Use…</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>very big</td><td>enormous / huge / massive</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very small</td><td>tiny / minute</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very hot</td><td>boiling / scorching</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very tired</td><td>exhausted / weary / drained</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very happy</td><td>delighted / thrilled</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very angry</td><td>furious / enraged / livid</td></tr>
    <tr><td>very good</td><td>excellent / outstanding / impressive</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>❌ The weather was very hot, and people were very tired.<br>
   ✅ The weather was scorching, and people were exhausted.</p>

<p>A single precise word immediately elevates your writing.</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Rule Two: Gradable vs Non-Gradable Adjectives</h3>

<p>Adjectives come in two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gradable</strong> — you can measure them (cold → very cold)</li>
  <li><strong>Non-gradable</strong> — absolute states (perfect, dead, impossible)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patterns:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Gradable → <em>very, a bit, rather, quite, extremely</em></li>
  <li>Non-gradable → <em>absolutely, completely, totally, utterly</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>She’s <em>absolutely exhausted</em>. (not “very exhausted”)</li>
  <li>The film was <em>utterly boring</em>.</li>
  <li>I’m <em>very tired</em>. (gradable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Small detail, big impact — examiners notice this.</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Rule Three: Learn Natural Collocations</h3>

<p>
  A collocation is a natural word partnership.  
  Native speakers don’t say <em>do a photo</em> or <em>make an exam</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>Common verb collocations:</strong></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><strong>take</strong></td><td>a photo, an exam, action, responsibility, part in</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>do</strong></td><td>research, homework, business, a favour</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>make</strong></td><td>a decision, progress, an effort, a mistake</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>give</strong></td><td>advice, a presentation, permission, a reason</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>pay</strong></td><td>attention, a visit, respect, a fine</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>have</strong></td><td>experience, difficulty, an impact</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We need to <em>take action</em> to reduce pollution.</li>
  <li>She <em>made an effort</em> to arrive on time.</li>
  <li>The teacher <em>gave advice</em> about improving grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Collocations are one of the fastest ways to sound natural at C1–C2.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Rule Four: Use Strong Adverb–Adjective Collocations</h3>

<p>These sound natural and advanced:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>bitterly</strong> disappointed/opposed/cold</li>
  <li><strong>deeply</strong> ashamed/grateful/concerned</li>
  <li><strong>highly</strong> successful/unlikely/recommended</li>
  <li><strong>totally</strong> different/unacceptable/honest</li>
  <li><strong>seriously</strong> damaged/ill/worried</li>
  <li><strong>utterly</strong> exhausted/useless/impossible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  
❌ People were very disappointed.  
✅ People were <em>bitterly disappointed</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Rule Five: Choose Verbs That Carry Meaning</h3>

<p>Weak verbs: <em>do, make, get, have</em><br>
Strong verbs: precise, academic, professional.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Weak expression</th><th>Stronger verb</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>make better</td><td>improve</td></tr>
    <tr><td>get worse</td><td>decline / deteriorate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>do research</td><td>conduct research</td></tr>
    <tr><td>make a decision</td><td>decide</td></tr>
    <tr><td>put into practice</td><td>apply</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>❌ We did research on this topic.  
      ✅ We <em>conducted research</em> on this topic.</li>
  <li>❌ The government must make better rules.  
      ✅ The government must <em>improve its regulations</em>.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>7. Rule Six: Replace Phrasal Verbs (when needed)</h3>

<p>
  Phrasal verbs are natural in speech, but in Cambridge essays they often sound informal.
</p>

<p><strong>Replace with more formal verbs:</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Informal</th><th>Formal</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>find out</td><td>discover</td></tr>
    <tr><td>give up</td><td>abandon</td></tr>
    <tr><td>come up with</td><td>propose / suggest</td></tr>
    <tr><td>look into</td><td>investigate / examine</td></tr>
    <tr><td>put off</td><td>postpone / delay</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  You don’t need to eliminate all phrasal verbs — just make conscious, formal choices.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Rule Seven: Avoid Wordiness</h3>

<p>Good writing says a lot with few words.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<p>❌ In today’s modern society of today...<br>
   ✅ Today…</p>

<p>❌ It is my opinion that teachers should be paid more.<br>
   ✅ Teachers should be paid more.</p>

<p>
  Cambridge examiners reward clarity and confidence, not filler.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Rule Eight: Learn Synonyms by Context</h3>

<p>
  The best synonym is the one that fits the meaning in context —  
  not the one that “sounds advanced.”
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>good</strong> → beneficial, positive, effective</li>
  <li><strong>bad</strong> → harmful, damaging</li>
  <li><strong>important</strong> → essential, vital, significant</li>
  <li><strong>big</strong> → major, substantial</li>
  <li><strong>small</strong> → minor, limited, slight</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
❌ The weather was crucial today.  
✔ The meeting was crucial today.</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. Rule Nine: Choose the Right Register</h3>

<p>
  Cambridge essays are formal or semi-formal. Avoid casual vocabulary.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Informal</th><th>Formal / Neutral</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>a lot of</td><td>numerous / a great deal of</td></tr>
    <tr><td>kids</td><td>children</td></tr>
    <tr><td>things / stuff</td><td>items / issues</td></tr>
    <tr><td>really / very</td><td>extremely / highly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I think</td><td>it seems / it appears</td></tr>
    <tr><td>because of</td><td>due to / owing to</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr>

<h3>11. Practice: Strengthen Your Vocabulary</h3>

<p>Transform these sentences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The results were very good.</li>
  <li>People are very angry about the changes.</li>
  <li>The problem got worse over time.</li>
  <li>We talked about pollution in class.</li>
  <li>The company made a decision to start a new project.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Possible answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The results were excellent.</li>
  <li>People were furious about the changes.</li>
  <li>The problem deteriorated over time.</li>
  <li>We discussed pollution in class.</li>
  <li>The company decided to start a new project.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>12. Bringing It All Together</h3>

<p>Before:</p>
<p>
  People are very worried about pollution.  
  It is a very big problem in cities.  
  Governments should make better laws and do more research about it.
</p>

<p>After:</p>
<p>
  People are deeply concerned about pollution, which has become a major issue in urban areas.
  Governments should improve environmental laws and conduct additional research to address it.
</p>

<p>
  Vocabulary precision transforms your writing into clear, fluent, exam-ready English.
</p>

<h3>13. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
  Your word choice tells the examiner who you are as a writer — precise, thoughtful, and in control.
  Grammar makes your writing correct, but vocabulary makes it <strong>convincing</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  In the next unit, you’ll learn to move from strong sentences to strong paragraphs,
  building essays that feel organised, logical, and natural to read.
