    <h1>Cohesion and Coherence</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In the previous unit, you learned how to build strong individual paragraphs. In this unit, you will learn
      how to make your <strong>paragraphs work together</strong> so that the whole text feels connected and easy to read.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Examiners call this <strong>cohesion</strong> (how sentences are linked) and <strong>coherence</strong>
      (how clearly the overall message is organised).

      <h2>1. What Is Cohesion?</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Cohesion</strong> is the way you connect sentences and paragraphs so that the text feels like
        one continuous piece, not separate parts.
      </p>

      <p>You create cohesion by using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>reference words</strong> (it, they, this, such a problem…)</li>
        <li><strong>substitution</strong> (do so, one, ones)</li>
        <li><strong>linking phrases</strong> (however, in addition, as a result…)</li>
        <li><strong>consistent vocabulary</strong> for the same ideas.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Low cohesion:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Online learning is popular. Online learning is convenient. Online learning is also flexible.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Improved cohesion:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Online learning is popular because it is convenient. It is also flexible, which makes it easier
            for people with busy schedules to study.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Reference and substitution -->
    <section id="u6-reference" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. Reference and Substitution</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of repeating the same words again and again, good writers use <strong>reference words</strong>
        and <strong>substitution</strong> to keep the text smooth.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Reference</h3>
      <p>Common reference words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>pronouns:</strong> it, they, this, that, these, those</li>
        <li><strong>determiners:</strong> such, the former, the latter</li>
        <li><strong>noun phrases:</strong> this issue, this trend, this problem</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Without reference:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Social media can be useful for staying in contact with friends. Social media can also be a distraction,
            and social media may reduce face-to-face communication.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>With reference:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Social media can be useful for staying in contact with friends. However, it can also be a distraction,
            and this may reduce face-to-face communication.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>2.2 Substitution</h3>
      <p>
        Substitution means replacing a word or phrase with a shorter one to avoid repetition.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>do so</strong> – repeat an action: <em>Some students read every day, but others don’t do so.</em></li>
        <li><strong>one / ones</strong> – repeat a noun: <em>Online courses can be helpful, especially short ones.</em></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Linking within/between paragraphs -->
    <section id="u6-linking" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. Linking Within and Between Paragraphs</h2>

      <p>
        You already know connectors such as <em>however</em> and <em>therefore</em>. Here, we focus on how to use them
        to link ideas smoothly.
      </p>

      <h3>Inside a paragraph</h3>
      <p>Use linkers to show:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>addition:</strong> in addition, moreover, furthermore</li>
        <li><strong>contrast:</strong> however, on the other hand, nevertheless</li>
        <li><strong>result:</strong> therefore, as a result, consequently</li>
        <li><strong>example:</strong> for example, for instance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Between paragraphs</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of a paragraph, you can use a short phrase to connect it to what came before.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>End of Paragraph 1:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            One advantage of online learning is flexibility, as students can decide when to study.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Beginning of Paragraph 2:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>However,</strong> this flexibility can also be a disadvantage, because it is easy for students
            to lose discipline.
          </em>

    </section>

    <!-- 4. Flow -->
    <section id="u6-flow" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Creating a Smooth Flow</h2>

      <p>
        Coherence is not only about linking words; it is about the <strong>order</strong> of your ideas.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Typical paragraph progression:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Topic sentence – main point.</li>
        <li>Explanation – why / how.</li>
        <li>Example – support.</li>
        <li>Mini-conclusion / link to the next paragraph.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Mini-conclusion and link:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            In this way, regular reading not only improves language level but also develops deeper concentration.
            <strong>In the next section, we will see how this affects exam performance.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Small phrases like <em>in this way</em>, <em>for this reason</em>, or <em>as a result</em> help your writing
        feel logically connected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Practice -->
    <section id="u6-practice" class="unit-section practice-section">
      <h2>5. Practice</h2>

      <h3>Task 1 – Add reference words</h3>
      <p>Improve cohesion by replacing repeated words with pronouns or “this + noun”.</p>

      <p><strong>Original:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Online learning is becoming more popular. Online learning allows students to study from home. Online learning
          also reduces travel costs.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Your version:</strong> Use <em>it</em>, <em>this</em>, or <em>this option</em> to avoid repetition.</p>

      <h3>Task 2 – Link two paragraphs</h3>
      <p>Write two short body paragraphs about the advantages and disadvantages of social media.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use at least <strong>one linking phrase</strong> at the start of the second paragraph.</li>
        <li>Use reference words instead of repeating “social media” every time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Final Thoughts -->
    <section id="u6-final" class="unit-section">
      <h2>6. Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Cohesion and coherence are what make your essay feel like one complete piece of writing. By using reference
        words, substitution, and clear linking between paragraphs, you help the examiner follow your argument without
        effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next units, we will focus on specific Cambridge tasks and see how to apply these skills to introductions,
        conclusions, and full essay structures.
