    <h1>Word Choice and Vocabulary Precision</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Once your sentences are grammatically correct, the next step is to make them sound natural and convincing.
      The difference between a simple B2 text and a strong C1/C2 essay is often not grammar, but word choice.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will focus on choosing words that are accurate, precise, and appropriate for Cambridge exams.
      We will look at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>why word choice matters for higher bands</li>
      <li>how to avoid weak words like <em>very</em></li>
      <li>how to use adjectives, collocations, and verbs naturally</li>
      <li>how to choose formal alternatives and the right register</li>
      <li>how to avoid wordiness and choose synonyms correctly</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      By the end of this unit, you will be able to make your writing clearer, more advanced, and more “native-like” –
      exactly what Cambridge examiners reward at higher levels.

    <!-- 1. Why word choice matters -->
    <section id="why-word-choice" class="unit-section">
      <h2 id="u6-opinion">1. Why Word Choice Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Look at these two sentences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People are angry about the situation.</li>
        <li>People are furious about the situation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both are correct, but the second one is stronger, more natural, and more advanced. It uses one precise word
        (<em>furious</em>) instead of two weaker ones (<em>very angry</em>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners sometimes write: <em>“Good control of vocabulary but limited range.”</em>
        This means your words are mostly correct, but not varied or rich enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reach higher bands (B2 → C1 → C2), you need to show:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>range</strong> – a variety of appropriate words</li>
        <li><strong>precision</strong> – words that express your exact meaning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the rest of this unit, you will see concrete techniques to expand both your range and your precision.
      </p>

    <!-- 2. Avoid "very" -->
    <section id="avoid-very" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. Avoid Weak Intensifiers like “Very”</h2>

      <p>
        Students often use <em>very</em> when they do not know a stronger word.
        However, <em>very</em> usually makes your writing weaker, not stronger.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>2.1 Replace “very” with a stronger word</h3>
        <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> <em>very + adjective</em>, choose a single, stronger adjective.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Very + adjective</th>
              <th>Stronger alternative(s)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>very big</td><td>enormous, huge, massive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very small</td><td>tiny, minute</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very hot</td><td>boiling, scorching</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very cold</td><td>freezing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very tired</td><td>exhausted, weary, drained</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very happy</td><td>delighted, thrilled</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very sad</td><td>miserable, heartbroken</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very angry</td><td>furious, enraged, livid</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very good</td><td>excellent, outstanding, impressive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>very bad</td><td>awful, terrible, dreadful</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          ❌ The weather was very hot, and people were very tired.<br>
          ✅ The weather was scorching, and people were exhausted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second sentence sounds more vivid and confident – exactly the tone you want in a Cambridge essay.

    <!-- 3. Gradable & non-gradable adjectives -->
    <section id="gradable-adjectives" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. Gradable and Non-Gradable Adjectives</h2>

      <p>
        Not all adjectives behave in the same way. Some are “measurable”; others are absolute.
        This affects which adverbs you can use with them.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>3.1 Gradable adjectives</h3>
        <p>
          Gradable adjectives describe qualities that can be stronger or weaker.
          You can be <em>a bit tired</em>, <em>quite tired</em>, or <em>very tired</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="formula">They work with: a bit, quite, very, rather, extremely</p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>She is quite tired today.</li>
          <li>I am very cold.</li>
          <li>They were extremely happy with the results.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>3.2 Non-gradable adjectives</h3>
        <p>
          Non-gradable adjectives describe absolute states or extremes.
          You cannot be “a bit dead” or “very perfect”.
        </p>

        <p class="formula">They work with: absolutely, completely, totally, utterly</p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>She was absolutely exhausted after the exam.</li>
          <li>The film was utterly boring.</li>
          <li>His explanation was completely wrong.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong></p>
        <p>
          ❌ very exhausted<br>
          ✅ absolutely exhausted
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        This may feel like a small detail, but examiners notice it. Correct use of gradable and non-gradable adjectives
        shows advanced control of vocabulary.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Collocations -->
    <section id="collocations" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Natural Word Partnerships (Collocations)</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>collocation</strong> is a natural combination of words that frequently appear together.
        Native speakers do not usually say <em>do a photo</em> or <em>make an exam</em> – they say:
      </p>

      <ul class="example-list">
        <li><strong>take</strong> a photo</li>
        <li><strong>take</strong> an exam</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In Cambridge essays, good collocations make your writing sound fluent and natural.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.1 Useful verb collocations for essays</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Take</strong>: a photo, an exam, action, responsibility, part in</li>
          <li><strong>Do</strong>: research, homework, business, a favour</li>
          <li><strong>Make</strong>: a decision, a difference, progress, an effort, a mistake</li>
          <li><strong>Give</strong>: advice, a presentation, permission, a reason</li>
          <li><strong>Pay</strong>: attention, a visit, respect, a fine, the price</li>
          <li><strong>Have</strong>: experience, difficulty, an impact, an effect</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We need to <strong>take action</strong> to reduce pollution.</li>
          <li>She <strong>made an effort</strong> to arrive on time.</li>
          <li>The teacher <strong>gave advice</strong> about improving grammar.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        Learning collocations is one of the most efficient ways to sound more advanced in writing.

    <!-- 5. Strong collocations -->
    <section id="strong-collocations" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Strong Collocations for Style</h2>

      <p>
        At higher levels, you can use stronger, more idiomatic collocations instead of “very + adjective”.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.1 Common strong collocations</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>bitterly</strong> disappointed, cold, opposed</li>
          <li><strong>deeply</strong> ashamed, grateful, concerned, moved</li>
          <li><strong>highly</strong> successful, unlikely, qualified, recommended</li>
          <li><strong>totally / completely</strong> different, alone, honest, unacceptable</li>
          <li><strong>seriously</strong> damaged, ill, worried, affected</li>
          <li><strong>utterly</strong> useless, impossible, exhausted</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
          ❌ People were very disappointed with the results.<br>
          ✅ People were <strong>bitterly disappointed</strong> with the results.
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        These combinations sound much more natural and “native-like” than simply using <em>very</em>.

    <!-- 6. Strong verbs -->
    <section id="strong-verbs" class="unit-section">
      <h2>6. Strong Verbs vs. Weak Verbs</h2>

      <p>
        Weak verbs like <em>do, make, get, have</em> often need extra words to carry the meaning.
        Strong verbs are more precise and formal – ideal for academic writing.

      <p>
        Phrasal verbs (such as <em>put off, give up, come up with</em>) are very common in spoken English.
        In formal Cambridge writing (especially at C1 and C2), it is often better to choose a more formal alternative.

      <p>
        Good writers say a lot with few words. Wordiness makes your writing heavy and unclear.

        You will learn how to connect sentences smoothly, express one idea clearly in each paragraph, and build a strong
        structure for your essay.
