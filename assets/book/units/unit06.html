      <h2>10. Rule Nine: Choose the Right Register</h2>

      <p>
        Cambridge essays are formal or semi-formal. Avoid casual vocabulary.
      </p>

      <table class="unit-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Informal</th><th>Formal / Neutral</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>a lot of</td><td>numerous / a great deal of</td></tr>
          <tr><td>kids</td><td>children</td></tr>
          <tr><td>things / stuff</td><td>items / issues</td></tr>
          <tr><td>really / very</td><td>extremely / highly</td></tr>
          <tr><td>I think</td><td>it seems / it appears</td></tr>

      <!-- 10.1 Opinion language -->
      <h3 id="u6-opinion">10.1 Showing Your Opinion with the Right Words</h3>
      <p>
        In Cambridge essays you <strong>must</strong> give your opinion, but the way you express it should sound
        formal and controlled. Instead of repeating <em>“I think…”</em> in every paragraph, use a range of
        neutral, academic phrases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>I think…</em> → <em>In my view… / In my opinion…</em></li>
        <li><em>I really think…</em> → <em>It seems clear that… / It appears that…</em></li>
        <li><em>I am sure…</em> → <em>I am convinced that…</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These expressions clearly show your position without sounding emotional or informal, which is
        exactly what examiners want.
      </p>

      <!-- 10.2 Task coverage -->
      <h3 id="u6-task-coverage">10.2 Covering All Parts of the Task</h3>
      <p>
        Vocabulary also helps you <strong>show</strong> that you have covered all the notes or bullet points in the
        exam question. Use clear signalling phrases so the examiner can easily see that you answered
        each part.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Firstly, regarding <strong>public transport</strong>, …</em></li>
        <li><em>Another important aspect is <strong>health</strong>, …</em></li>
        <li><em>Finally, considering <strong>young people’s free time</strong>, …</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These phrases connect your ideas directly to the task notes. If your essay loses marks for
        “task achievement”, strengthening these signals is an easy win.
      </p>

      <!-- 10.3 Text type -->
      <h3 id="u6-text-type">10.3 Vocabulary That Fits the Text Type</h3>
      <p>
        Different exam tasks need slightly different vocabulary. An <strong>essay</strong> usually needs neutral,
        academic language. A <strong>review</strong> needs opinion words about books, films, or places. An
        <strong>article</strong> can be a bit more personal and engaging.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essay:</strong> <em>advantages, disadvantages, moreover, on the other hand, in conclusion</em></li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> <em>entertaining, disappointing, gripping, highly recommended</em></li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> <em>imagine, surprisingly, one of the best ways</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When your vocabulary matches the text type, examiners feel that you understand the task,
        not just the language.
