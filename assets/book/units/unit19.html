<h2>Unit 19: Mastering the C2 Essay Task</h2>

<p>
In this unit, we explore the C2 essay task in detail: what the exam demands, how it differs from
C1, and how to plan, develop, and write with the maturity and control of a native-level academic
writer.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Nature of the C2 Essay Task</h3>

<p>
In the Cambridge Proficiency (CPE) exam, Part 1 of the Writing paper is always an essay based on
two short texts (often articles, reports, or extracts).
</p>

<p>You must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>read the texts carefully,</li>
  <li>identify their main ideas,</li>
  <li>compare or evaluate them, and</li>
  <li>present a well-argued response based on your own opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Typically, the task asks you to <strong>summarise and evaluate</strong> the key points, 
<strong>compare perspectives</strong>, and <strong>add your own argument</strong> — in about 
<strong>240–280 words</strong>.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Sample task (simplified):</strong></p>
  <p>You have read two extracts about the role of risk in people’s lives.</p>
  <p><em>Write an essay summarising and evaluating the key points from both texts.  
  Use your own ideas to develop your response.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
This may sound similar to the C1 task, but at C2 the difference lies in <strong>depth</strong> and
<strong>flexibility</strong>.
Examiners are looking for your ability to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>think critically,</li>
  <li>connect ideas across texts,</li>
  <li>and express nuanced conclusions with confidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this level, writing is not about following formulas; it is about thinking clearly, writing fluidly,
and expressing complex ideas with accuracy and style.
</p>

<p>
Reaching C2 means reaching the summit of English writing — not just knowing how to build sentences,
but how to shape ideas with elegance and conviction.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. What Examiners Are Looking For</h3>

<p>
At the C2 level, all four marking criteria still apply, but they are assessed with higher expectations.
</p>

<table class="table-2col">
  <tr>
    <th>Criterion</th>
    <th>What It Means at C2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Content</strong></td>
    <td>You fully understand, summarise, and evaluate both texts accurately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Communicative Achievement</strong></td>
    <td>Your essay is academic, fluent, and persuasive without being mechanical.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Organisation</strong></td>
    <td>Paragraphs flow naturally; ideas are connected logically and stylistically.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Language</strong></td>
    <td>Range, flexibility, and precision — near-native command of grammar and lexis.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>In short:</strong><br>
C1 rewards control.  
C2 rewards sophistication.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Key Difference Between C1 and C2 Essays</h3>

<table class="table-2col">
  <tr>
    <th>Element</th>
    <th>C1 (Advanced)</th>
    <th>C2 (Proficiency)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Task Type</strong></td>
    <td>Discuss two opinions and give your view.</td>
    <td>Summarise, evaluate, and develop ideas from two texts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Focus</strong></td>
    <td>Clear argument, balanced reasoning.</td>
    <td>Depth, insight, and synthesis of ideas.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Language</strong></td>
    <td>Accurate, formal, and controlled.</td>
    <td>Flexible, natural, and stylistically mature.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tone</strong></td>
    <td>Academic, calm, confident.</td>
    <td>Analytical, refined, and subtly persuasive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Word Count</strong></td>
    <td>220–260 words.</td>
    <td>240–280 words.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
So while the C1 essay shows logical control, the C2 essay shows <strong>intellectual voice</strong> —
how you think about ideas, not just describe them.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Reading and Understanding the Source Texts</h3>

<p>
At this level, your first task is not to write — it is to read intelligently.
</p>

<p>When you read the two short texts, focus on four questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>What are the main ideas of each?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What assumptions or attitudes do they reveal?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Where do they agree or disagree?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How do they relate to the question?</strong></li>
</ol>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example texts about risk:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Text A:</strong> “Taking risks is necessary for personal growth. People who avoid risk often fail to discover their potential.”</p>
  <p><strong>Text B:</strong> “Modern society glorifies risk-taking, yet most success comes from patience and consistency rather than impulsive decisions.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this, you can see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both discuss risk, but from different perspectives.</li>
  <li>Text A values boldness; Text B values stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A strong essay will <strong>summarise both</strong> and <strong>evaluate the tension between them</strong> —
before giving your own reasoned conclusion.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Planning a C2 Essay</h3>

<p>
Planning is shorter but sharper at this level.  
Your goal: clarity of structure, flexibility of thought.
</p>

<p><strong>Recommended outline:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> summarise the topic and mention both texts (≈ 40–50 words)</li>
  <li><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> discuss and evaluate Text A (≈ 60–70 words)</li>
  <li><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> discuss and evaluate Text B, with comparison (≈ 60–70 words)</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> integrate and give your final, balanced view (≈ 50–60 words)</li>
</ul>

<p>
C2 essays must feel coherent but <strong>not formulaic</strong>.  
Your plan gives you direction, but your thinking adds life.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example introduction:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Both texts explore the idea of risk as a defining factor in human progress. While the first 
    emphasises the value of taking chances to achieve growth, the second questions this assumption, 
    suggesting that stability may be a more reliable path to success.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Your introduction should summarise the issue raised in both texts — briefly, neutrally, and clearly.</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Writing an Elegant Introduction</h3>

<p>An effective C2 introduction is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>simple, factual, and fluent,</li>
  <li>focused on ideas, not on the exam task itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Avoid filler phrases such as:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“In this essay I will discuss…”</li>
  <li>“This essay is going to talk about…”</li>
</ul>

<p>You start with ideas, not instructions.</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Analysing and Evaluating (Not Just Summarising)</h3>

<p>C2 examiners look for <strong>evaluation</strong> — your ability to respond to ideas, not just describe them.</p>

<p>
<strong>Summarising</strong> = restating what the text says.  
<strong>Evaluating</strong> = analysing why it matters or how convincing it is.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Text A claims that risk is essential for personal development. This argument is persuasive, as 
    individuals often learn more from challenges than from comfort. However, it overlooks the potential 
    cost of failure, which may discourage some people from taking meaningful risks.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Notice how the paragraph includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a brief summary (what the text says),</li>
  <li>evaluation (your analysis),</li>
  <li>balance (strengths and limitations).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is exactly what earns top marks at C2.</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Linking and Synthesis Between Texts</h3>

<p>
You must also link the two texts and show how they relate.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p>
    Both writers consider the relationship between risk and achievement, yet they interpret it 
    differently. Whereas the first associates risk with progress, the second connects it with 
    instability and wasted potential.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
The word <strong>“whereas”</strong> immediately signals comparison.  
Your essay now reads like a single coherent response, not two separate summaries.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Developing Your Own Argument</h3>

<p>
After discussing both texts, move naturally into your own perspective.
This is where your academic voice takes centre stage.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p>
    In my view, taking risks is valuable only when supported by preparation and self-awareness. Blind 
    courage may lead to short-term excitement, but true success requires calculated decision-making and 
    resilience.
  </p>
</div>

<p>This type of writing shows independence, reflection, and stylistic control.</p>

<p>At this stage, it’s no longer about grammar; it’s about judgement.</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. Using Sophisticated Linking Phrases</h3>

<p>
At C2 level, you should go beyond the most common connectors (
<em>however, in addition, therefore</em>) and use a wider, more natural range.
</p>

<table class="table-2col">
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Phrases</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Contrast</strong></td>
    <td>whereas, while, on the contrary, by contrast, despite this</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Cause / Effect</strong></td>
    <td>consequently, thus, hence, as a result, this leads to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Evaluation</strong></td>
    <td>this argument appears convincing, this claim seems less persuasive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Balance</strong></td>
    <td>although, even though, on the one hand… on the other hand</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Summarising</strong></td>
    <td>overall, ultimately, all things considered, in essence</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>
    While the argument in the first text is compelling, it risks oversimplifying the complex nature of 
    decision-making in modern life.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Note how the link is smooth, academic, and natural — exactly the tone of C2.</p>

<hr>

<h3>11. Maintaining a Natural, Academic Tone</h3>

<p>At this level, avoid both extremes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Too formal:</strong> “It is incontrovertibly evident that…”</li>
  <li><strong>Too casual:</strong> “I think people should just be brave.”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aim for elegant simplicity:</strong></p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p>Risk-taking can drive innovation, but it also requires judgement and balance.</p>
</div>

<p>
Short, clear sentences with strong nouns and verbs create authority.  
C2 writing feels confident — never rushed, never artificial.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>12. Model C2 Essay (≈ 260 words)</h3>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Summarise and evaluate the key points from both texts about risk-taking.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p>
    Both texts discuss the value of taking risks, but from contrasting perspectives. The first argues 
    that risk is essential for growth, suggesting that individuals who avoid challenges also limit 
    their potential. The second, however, views risk more critically, pointing out that stability and 
    long-term commitment are often more effective routes to success.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first text’s optimistic view is persuasive, as progress in any field requires stepping beyond 
    one’s comfort zone. Without risk, innovation would stagnate, and personal development would be 
    limited. Nevertheless, it overlooks the fact that not all risk is productive; failure can be 
    discouraging, and recklessness may cause long-term harm.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second text offers a valuable reminder that caution and persistence often lead to sustainable 
    results. Its argument is balanced, though perhaps too cautious, as it underestimates the role of 
    boldness in driving change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, both texts highlight essential aspects of human progress. In my view, risk is most 
    valuable when combined with preparation and reflection. People should neither avoid it completely 
    nor pursue it blindly, but approach it as a necessary ingredient for growth, managed through 
    self-awareness and responsibility.
  </p>
</div>

<p><strong>This model shows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Clear summary of both texts.</li>
  <li>✅ Balanced evaluation.</li>
  <li>✅ Mature personal viewpoint.</li>
  <li>✅ Controlled, formal tone.</li>
  <li>✅ Fluent, varied language.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what a Band 4–5 (C2-level) essay looks like.</p>

<hr>

<h3>13. Common C2 Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake: Over-summarising</strong><br>
    <em>Example:</em> Simply restating what both texts say.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Add evaluation and personal insight.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mistake: Over-formality</strong><br>
    <em>Example:</em> “It is irrefutably undeniable that…”<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Simplify: “It is clear that…”
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mistake: Lack of synthesis</strong><br>
    <em>Example:</em> Treating each text separately.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Compare and link throughout.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mistake: Over-opinionated tone</strong><br>
    <em>Example:</em> “The second text is wrong.”<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> “The second text’s argument seems less convincing.”
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mistake: Ignoring the word limit</strong><br>
    <em>Example:</em> Writing 320 words.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Stay within 240–280. Clarity is more important than quantity.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Your goal is balance — depth without heaviness, elegance without pretension.
</p>
