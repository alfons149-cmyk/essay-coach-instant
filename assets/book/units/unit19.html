    <!-- 1. Nature of the C2 task -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u19-task">
      <h2>1. The Nature of the C2 Essay Task</h2>

      <p>
        In the <strong>Cambridge Proficiency (CPE)</strong> exam, Part 1 of the Writing paper is
        always an <strong>essay</strong> based on <strong>two short texts</strong>
        (often articles, reports, or extracts).
      </p>

      <p>You must:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>read the texts carefully,</li>
        <li>identify their main ideas,</li>
        <li>compare or evaluate them, and</li>
        <li>present a well-argued response based on your own opinion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The task typically asks you to <strong>summarise and evaluate</strong> the key points,
        <strong>compare perspectives</strong>, and <strong>add your own argument</strong> – in about
        <strong>240–280 words</strong>.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Sample Task</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            You have read two extracts about the role of risk in people’s lives.<br>
            Write an essay summarising and evaluating the key points from both texts.<br>
            Use your own ideas to develop your response.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        This may sound similar to C1, but at C2 the difference lies in
        <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>.
        Examiners are looking for your ability to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>think critically,</li>
        <li>connect ideas across texts,</li>
        <li>express nuanced conclusions with confidence.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. What examiners look for -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u19-criteria">
      <h2>2. What Examiners Are Looking For</h2>

      <p>
        At the C2 level, all four marking criteria still apply, but they are assessed with
        higher expectations.
      </p>

      <table class="structure-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>

            <td>You fully understand, summarise, and evaluate both texts accurately.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Communicative Achievement</strong></td>
            <td>Your essay is academic, fluent, and persuasive without being mechanical.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        In short:<br>
        <strong>C1</strong> rewards control.<br>
        <strong>C2</strong> rewards sophistication.

      </table>

      <p>
        So while the C1 essay shows logical <strong>control</strong>, the C2 essay shows
        an <strong>intellectual voice</strong> – how you think about ideas, not just describe them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Reading and understanding -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u19-reading">
      <h2>4. Reading and Understanding the Source Texts</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, your first task is not to write – it is to read intelligently.
      </p>

      <p>When you read the two short texts, focus on four questions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What are the <strong>main ideas</strong> of each?</li>
        <li>What <strong>assumptions or attitudes</strong> do they reveal?</li>
        <li>Where do they <strong>agree or disagree</strong>?</li>
        <li>How do they <strong>relate to the question</strong>?</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example texts</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Text A:</strong><br>
          <em>
            “Taking risks is necessary for personal growth. People who avoid risk often fail to
            discover their potential.”
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Text B:</strong><br>
          <em>
            “Modern society glorifies risk-taking, yet most success comes from patience and
            consistency rather than impulsive decisions.”
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>From this, you can see:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Both discuss <strong>risk</strong>, but from opposite perspectives.</li>
        <li>Text A values <strong>boldness</strong>; Text B values <strong>stability</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A strong essay will <strong>summarise both</strong>, then
        <strong>evaluate the tension between them</strong>.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u19-planning">
      <h2>5. Planning a C2 Essay</h2>

      <p>
        Planning is shorter but sharper at this level.
        Your goal: clarity of structure, flexibility of thought.

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Recommended outline</h3>
        <ul class="breakdown-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Introduction</strong> – summarise the topic and mention both texts
            (<em>≈ 40–50 words</em>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Body paragraph 1</strong> – discuss and evaluate Text A
            (<em>≈ 60–70 words</em>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Body paragraph 2</strong> – discuss and evaluate Text B, with some comparison
            (<em>≈ 60–70 words</em>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong> – integrate ideas and give your final, balanced view
            (<em>≈ 50–60 words</em>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        C2 essays must feel coherent but <strong>not formulaic</strong>.
        Your plan gives you direction, but your thinking adds life.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u19-introduction">
      <h2>6. Writing an Elegant Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Your introduction should summarise the issue raised in both texts – briefly, neutrally,
        and clearly.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p class="example">

            Both texts explore the idea of risk as a defining factor in human progress. While the
            first emphasises the value of taking chances to achieve growth, the second questions this
            assumption, suggesting that stability may be a more reliable path to success.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        ✔ Simple, factual, and fluent.<br>

      <h2>7. Analysing and Evaluating (Not Just Summarising)</h2>

      <p>
        C2 examiners look for <strong>evaluation</strong> – your ability to respond to ideas,
        not just describe them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Summarising</strong> = restating what the text says.<br>
        <strong>Evaluating</strong> = analysing why it matters or how convincing it is.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            Text A claims that risk is essential for personal development. This argument is persuasive,
            as individuals often learn more from challenges than from comfort. However, it overlooks
            the potential cost of failure, which may discourage some people from taking meaningful
            risks.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>Notice how you include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a short <strong>summary</strong> (what the text says),</li>
        <li><strong>evaluation</strong> (your analysis),</li>
        <li><strong>balance</strong> (strengths and limitations).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That is exactly what earns top marks at C2 – not a long summary, but a short, thoughtful one.

            The second text offers a valuable reminder that caution and persistence often lead to
            sustainable results. Its argument is balanced, though perhaps too cautious, as it
            underestimates the role of boldness in driving change.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            Ultimately, both texts highlight essential aspects of human progress. In my view, risk is
            most valuable when combined with preparation and reflection. People should neither avoid
            it completely nor pursue it blindly, but approach it as a necessary ingredient for growth,
            managed through self-awareness and responsibility.
          </em>

      </article>

      <p>Why this works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Clear summary of both texts.</li>
        <li>✔ Balanced evaluation.</li>
        <li>✔ Mature personal viewpoint.</li>
        <li>✔ Controlled, formal tone.</li>
        <li>✔ Fluent, varied language.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Mastering the C2 essay means learning to think and write with quiet sophistication.
        It is not about more vocabulary or longer sentences.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is about <strong>precision</strong>, <strong>connection</strong>, and
        <strong>mature reasoning</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this level:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>you do not just answer the question – you explore it,</li>
        <li>you do not just argue – you evaluate,</li>
        <li>you do not just write – you communicate thought.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        Remember:<br>
        <strong>B2</strong> builds structure.<br>
        <strong>C1</strong> builds control.<br>
        <strong>C2</strong> builds insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when you sit the C2 exam, do not write to impress – write to express.
        Trust your preparation, think calmly, and let your ideas flow in clear, confident English.
      </p>

      <section class="unit-section" id="u19-summary">
  <h2>12. Summary & Quick Reference</h2>

  <p>
    Unit 19 showed you how to approach the <strong>C2 essay task</strong>, where the goal is not just to write an
    opinion piece but to <strong>analyse, integrate, and evaluate</strong> ideas from the texts.  
    Use this summary as a quick reminder of what the examiner expects at the highest level.
  </p>

  <!-- WHAT THE C2 TASK REQUIRES -->
  <h3>✔ What the C2 Essay Really Tests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understanding</strong> — showing the key points of each text accurately.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration</strong> — combining ideas from both texts logically.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation</strong> — assessing strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, and implications.</li>
    <li><strong>Position</strong> — presenting a clear, well-justified viewpoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Academic control</strong> — tone, structure, cohesion, precision.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Weak (descriptive):</strong></p>
    <p>Text A says that social media is harmful. Text B says it has benefits.</p>

    <p><strong>Strong (evaluative + integrative):</strong></p>
    <p>
      While Text A highlights psychological risks associated with excessive social media use,
      Text B convincingly argues that these risks depend largely on how the platforms are used —
      a distinction that Text A does not fully address.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- INTEGRATING SOURCES -->
  <h3>✔ How to Integrate the Texts Smoothly</h3>
  <p>At C2 level, paragraphs should <strong>blend</strong> ideas—never treat the texts separately.</p>

  <h4>Useful integration frames:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Text A argues…, while Text B suggests…</em></li>
    <li><em>Both texts highlight…, but they differ in…</em></li>
    <li><em>Text B builds on Text A’s point by…</em></li>
    <li><em>Although Text A criticises…, it does not consider… explored in Text B.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Separated:</strong></p>
    <p>Text A mentions the lack of regulation. Text B focuses on personal responsibility.</p>

    <p><strong>Integrated:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Although Text A attributes online misinformation to weak regulation,
      Text B shifts responsibility toward individual users, implying a more decentralised solution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- EVALUATION -->
  <h3>✔ Evaluating Arguments: What C2 Examiners Look For</h3>
  <p>You must show what each text <strong>gets right</strong>, <strong>overlooks</strong>, or <strong>assumes</strong>.</p>

  <h4>Evaluate by checking:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> clarity, evidence, logic, relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> exaggeration, missing evidence, weak assumptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Balance:</strong> does the text acknowledge complexity?</li>
    <li><strong>Implications:</strong> what follows if the argument is accepted?</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Minimal evaluation:</strong></p>
    <p>Text A gives good reasons, but it is too negative.</p>

    <p><strong>Strong evaluation:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Text A provides convincing evidence through recent statistical studies,
      but its conclusion assumes that increased screen time automatically leads to lower wellbeing —
      an assumption not fully supported by the data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- POSITION -->
  <h3>✔ Showing a Strong, C2-Level Position</h3>
  <p>Your opinion should be: <strong>clear, well-argued, and built on the texts</strong>—not personal stories.</p>

  <h4>Effective ways to express your position:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><em>I contend that…</em></li>
    <li><em>This essay argues that…</em></li>
    <li><em>Although Text A raises valid concerns, I agree with Text B that…</em></li>
    <li><em>The evidence presented suggests that…</em></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Weak:</strong></p>
    <p>I agree with Text A because I’ve seen this happen in my own life.</p>

    <p><strong>Strong:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Although Text A highlights legitimate risks, Text B presents a more balanced view,
      offering a solution that addresses both personal responsibility and systemic challenges.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STRUCTURE -->
  <h3>✔ Quick C2 Essay Structure (Perfect for Exam Day)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Intro:</strong> summarise both texts objectively + state your approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Body 1:</strong> key idea → integrate both texts → evaluate.</li>
    <li><strong>Body 2:</strong> another key idea → integrate → evaluate → lead to your position.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> clear final judgement, rooted in both texts.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CHECKLIST -->
  <h3>✔ C2 Quick Checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Have I integrated the texts in every paragraph?</li>
    <li>Have I evaluated ideas, not just described them?</li>
    <li>Have I avoided personal stories/opinions?</li>
    <li>Is my argument balanced and insightful?</li>
    <li>Is the tone academic, precise, and confident?</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- PRACTICE -->
  <h3>✔ Try It Yourself</h3>
  <pre class="code-block">
Rewrite this at C2 level (integrate + evaluate):

  Text A says city life is stressful.
  Text B says cities offer better opportunities.

Targets:
  • Show the relationship between ideas
  • Evaluate strengths/weaknesses
  • Provide a clear, academic tone
