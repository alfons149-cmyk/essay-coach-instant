    <h1>Editing for Accuracy</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      You’ve planned, written, and organised your essay. Now comes the step many students rush –
      or skip completely: <strong>editing</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Good writers don’t stop when they finish the last sentence. They pause, breathe, and
      <strong>check</strong>. Editing is not about perfection; it’s about clarity. It’s the moment you turn
      good writing into confident, controlled writing – the kind that Cambridge examiners
      immediately trust.

    <!-- 1. Why Editing Matters -->
    <section id="u11-why-editing-matters" class="unit-section">
      <h2>1. Why Editing Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Even excellent ideas lose power when they are hidden under small mistakes. Grammar slips,
        missing commas, or repeated words can make a strong essay look careless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Editing is your chance to catch those small errors before the examiner does. It is also a way
        to show maturity: you don’t panic, you check your work like a professional.
      </p>

      <p class="tip">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> <em>Writing shows your ideas. Editing shows your control.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners value accuracy highly. A student who writes clearly, even with simple
        language, often scores higher than one who uses advanced words incorrectly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. How Much Time to Spend -->
    <section id="u11-time" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. How Much Time to Spend</h2>

      <p>
        You have about <strong>5 minutes</strong> at the end of your essay for editing. That’s enough –
        if you use it well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those 5 minutes can easily improve your mark by half a band, sometimes even a full band. So
        plan your timing like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>5–7 minutes</strong> to plan</li>
        <li><strong>25 minutes</strong> to write</li>
        <li><strong>5 minutes</strong> to check and polish</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is not to rewrite everything, but to correct the parts that weaken your essay.

    <!-- 3. The Four Levels of Editing -->
    <section id="u11-four-levels" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. The Four Levels of Editing</h2>

      <p>To edit efficiently, follow this order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Content and Organisation</strong> – Is everything clear and complete?</li>
        <li><strong>Grammar and Sentence Structure</strong> – Are tenses and agreement correct?</li>
        <li><strong>Vocabulary and Word Choice</strong> – Are words appropriate, precise, and formal?</li>
        <li><strong>Punctuation and Spelling</strong> – Are commas, full stops, and capitals correct?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We’ll go through each level one by one.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Level 1: Content and Organisation -->
    <section id="u11-level1" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Level 1: Content and Organisation</h2>

      <p>
        Before checking small details, make sure your essay answers the task.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Did I include all three notes from the question?</li>
        <li>Did I give my opinion clearly?</li>
        <li>Does each paragraph have one clear idea?</li>
        <li>Does the essay flow logically from beginning to end?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example of a missing note</strong></p>
        <p>
          ❌ Essay about health that covers <strong>diet</strong> and <strong>stress</strong> but forgets
          <strong>your own idea</strong>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add a short extra paragraph:</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Another important factor is getting enough rest. Sleep helps the body recover and stay
            strong.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Fixing content is more important than fixing commas. If your essay doesn’t answer the full
        question, your score drops immediately – no matter how beautiful the grammar.
      </p>

    <!-- 5. Level 2: Grammar and Sentence Structure -->
    <section id="u11-level2" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Level 2: Grammar and Sentence Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Now zoom in. Look for the mistakes that lower accuracy marks: verb forms, agreement,
        articles, and sentence control.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Use this checklist:</strong></p>

      <h3>Verb tense</h3>
      <p>Are all verbs in the correct tense?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Last year</strong> → past</li>
        <li><strong>now</strong> → present</li>
        <li><strong>in the future</strong> → will / going to</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Subject–verb agreement</h3>
      <p>Does the verb match the subject?</p>
      <p>✅ <em>People like</em> exercise. ❌ <em>People likes</em> exercise.</p>

      <h3>Articles</h3>
      <p>Are <strong>a / an / the</strong> used correctly?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>the</strong> for specific things.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>a / an</strong> for general, countable things.</li>
        <li>Avoid plurals with uncountable nouns.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>Informations</em><br>✅ <em>information</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>Sentence length</h3>
      <p>Are any sentences too long or joined incorrectly?</p>
      <p>Split long sentences with a full stop or a semicolon.</p>

      <h3>Relative clauses</h3>
      <p>Are <strong>who / which / that</strong> used correctly?</p>
      <p>✅ <em>People who recycle help the planet.</em></p>

      <h3>If-clauses</h3>
      <p>Are conditional structures correct?</p>
      <p>✅ <em>If people exercised more, they would feel healthier.</em></p>

      <p>
        When editing, read slowly and “aloud in your head”. Your ear often catches mistakes your eyes
        miss.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>People enjoys doing exercise because it make them relax.</em></p>
        <p>✅ <em>People enjoy doing exercise because it makes them relax.</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>Tiny corrections like these immediately improve your accuracy.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Level 3: Vocabulary and Word Choice -->
    <section id="u11-level3" class="unit-section">
      <h2>6. Level 3: Vocabulary and Word Choice</h2>

      <p>
        Next, look at your word choices. Are they appropriate for a Cambridge essay? Formal writing
        doesn’t need difficult words – just the <strong>right</strong> ones.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Check for these five things:</strong></p>

      <h3>(a) Avoid informal or spoken words</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>Kids these days don’t care about recycling.</em></p>
        <p>✅ <em>Many young people today do not care enough about recycling.</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Replace “very + adjective”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ very good → ✅ <strong>excellent</strong></li>
        <li>❌ very bad → ✅ <strong>terrible</strong></li>
        <li>❌ very important → ✅ <strong>essential / crucial</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>(c) Use variety instead of repetition</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>important… important… important</em></p>
        <p>✅ <em>important… essential… significant</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>(d) Check collocations (word combinations)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ <em>make a research</em> → ✅ <em>do / conduct research</em></li>
        <li>❌ <em>strong rain</em> → ✅ <em>heavy rain</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>(e) Avoid vague words</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ <em>things, stuff, a lot of, nice</em></li>
        <li>✅ <em>issues, materials, many, beneficial</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each time you replace a vague or informal word with a precise one, you show control. That’s
        exactly what examiners mean by “range of vocabulary”.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Level 4: Punctuation and Spelling -->
    <section id="u11-level4" class="unit-section">
      <h2>7. Level 4: Punctuation and Spelling</h2>

      <p>
        Now look at the technical side of writing. Punctuation doesn’t only mark pauses – it shows
        your reader how to follow your ideas.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Full stops</h3>
      <p>Every sentence must end with one complete idea.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>I think exercise is important it helps people stay healthy.</em></p>
        <p>✅ <em>I think exercise is important. It helps people stay healthy.</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Commas</h3>
      <p>Use them to separate clauses or after linking phrases.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <em>In my opinion, public transport should be free.</em></li>
        <li>✅ <em>Although it is expensive, many people still drive to work.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Avoid overusing commas – one per sentence is usually enough.</p>

      <h3>(c) Capital letters</h3>
      <p>Start sentences and proper nouns with a capital:</p>
      <p>✅ <em>The River Thames flows through London.</em></p>

      <h3>(d) Spelling</h3>
      <p><strong>Common tricky words:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>environment ✅ (not <em>enviroment</em>)</li>
        <li>government ✅ (not <em>goverment</em>)</li>
        <li>necessary ✅ (two s’s, one c)</li>
        <li>definitely ✅ (not <em>definately</em>)</li>
        <li>people ✅ (not <em>peoples</em>, unless it means nations)</li>
        <li><strong>their / there / they’re</strong> → choose carefully.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the exam, you can’t use a spellchecker. Practise writing key words by hand – it trains your
        memory.

      <h2>8. How to Check Efficiently in Five Minutes</h2>

      <p>Here’s a calm, systematic approach for your final five minutes:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraph 1 (Introduction)</strong><br>
          Does it answer the question?<br>
          Is your opinion clear?<br>
          No contractions (<em>don’t, can’t</em>)?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraphs 2–3 (Body)</strong><br>
          Each paragraph = one clear idea?<br>
          Linking words used naturally?<br>
          Grammar consistent?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraph 4 (Conclusion)</strong><br>
          Clear summary and final opinion?<br>
          No new information?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole essay</strong><br>
          Word count roughly <strong>140–190 words</strong>?<br>
          No obvious spelling or punctuation errors?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Use your pencil to underline or lightly mark errors. Then correct them neatly – legibility
        matters.

    <!-- 9. Editing Tricks for Speed -->
    <section id="u11-tricks" class="unit-section">
      <h2>9. Editing Tricks for Speed</h2>

      <p>
        Even when time is short, these small techniques make editing faster and smarter.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Read backwards, sentence by sentence</h3>
      <p>
        Start from the last sentence and move up. It breaks the “flow” of reading and helps you notice
        grammar or spelling mistakes.
      </p>

      <h3>(b) Use your finger or pencil to guide your eyes</h3>
      <p>
        Move slowly under each line. Your brain slows down and pays more attention.
      </p>

      <h3>(c) Circle linking words</h3>
      <p>
        If you find too many <em>and / but / because</em>, replace one or two with more advanced
        connectors such as <em>although, therefore, however</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>(d) Highlight verbs mentally</h3>
      <p>
        Check if they all agree with the subject and stay in the same tense. Small correction, big
        effect.

    <section id="u11-self-correction" class="unit-section">
      <h2>11. Self-Correction Strategies (Before the Exam)</h2>

      <p>
        Editing is easier in the exam if you practise it during preparation. Try these habits:
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Keep an error notebook</h3>
      <p>Write down your own most frequent mistakes and the correct forms.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>❌ <em>people likes</em> → ✅ <em>people like</em></p>
        <p>❌ <em>I am agree</em> → ✅ <em>I agree</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>Look through your notebook before every writing practice.</p>

      <h3>(b) Use colour when editing drafts</h3>
      <p>
        In your practice essays at home, highlight grammar issues in one colour, vocabulary in
        another, and connectors in a third. It trains your eyes to <strong>see patterns</strong> in your
        mistakes.
      </p>

      <h3>(c) Compare your writing to model answers</h3>
      <p>
        Notice how the model uses transitions, punctuation, and tone. Ask: <em>Does my version sound too
        casual or too mechanical?</em>
      </p>

      <h3>(d) Time yourself</h3>
      <p>
        Practise editing under real exam conditions. Try reading and correcting your essay in exactly
        five minutes.

      <p>
        Accuracy is vital, but don’t let it stop your flow. Some students become so afraid of making

      <h2>14. What Examiners Notice When You Edit</h2>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners read quickly, but they can tell when a student has edited their work.
        They notice:
      </p>

      <ul>

      <p>
        Editing is the quiet strength behind every good writer. It’s not dramatic, but it’s powerful.
        It is the final handshake between your ideas and your reader.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you edit, you say: <br>
        <em>“I respect my writing enough to polish it.”</em> And that respect shows in every line.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Planning</strong> gives structure. <strong>Writing</strong> gives meaning.
        <strong>Editing</strong> gives quality.
