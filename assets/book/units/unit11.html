<h2>Unit 11: Editing for Accuracy</h2>

<p>
  You’ve planned, written, and organised your essay.  
  Now comes the step many students rush – or skip completely: <strong>editing</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Good writers don’t stop when they finish the last sentence. They pause, breathe, and check.
  Editing is not about perfection; it’s about clarity. It’s the moment you turn your good writing
  into confident, controlled writing – the kind that Cambridge examiners immediately trust.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. Why Editing Matters</h3>

<p>
  Even excellent ideas lose power when they’re hidden under small mistakes. Grammar slips, missing
  commas, or repeated words can make a strong essay look careless.
</p>

<p>
  Editing is your chance to catch those small errors before the examiner does. It’s also a way to
  show maturity: you don’t panic, you check your work like a professional.
</p>

<p><strong>Remember this rule:</strong></p>

<p><em>Writing shows your ideas. Editing shows your control.</em></p>

<p>
  Cambridge examiners value accuracy highly. A student who writes clearly, even with simple
  language, often scores higher than one who uses advanced words incorrectly.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. How Much Time to Spend</h3>

<p>
  You have about <strong>5 minutes</strong> at the end of your essay for editing.  
  That’s enough – if you use it well.
</p>

<p>
  Those 5 minutes can easily improve your mark by half a band, sometimes even a full band.
</p>

<p><strong>A realistic timing:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>5–7 minutes to plan</li>
  <li>25 minutes to write</li>
  <li>5 minutes to check and polish</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The goal is not to rewrite everything, but to correct what weakens your essay.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Four Levels of Editing</h3>

<p>To edit efficiently, follow this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Content and Organisation</strong> – Is everything clear and complete?</li>
  <li><strong>Grammar and Sentence Structure</strong> – Are tenses and agreement correct?</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary and Word Choice</strong> – Are words appropriate, precise, and formal?</li>
  <li><strong>Punctuation and Spelling</strong> – Are commas, full stops, and capitals correct?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll go through each level one by one.</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Level 1: Content and Organisation</h3>

<p>
  Before checking small details, make sure your essay answers the task.
</p>

<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Did I include all three notes from the question?</li>
  <li>Did I give my opinion clearly?</li>
  <li>Does each paragraph have one clear idea?</li>
  <li>Does the essay flow logically from beginning to end?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example of a missing note:</strong></p>

<p>
  ❌ Essay about health that covers <em>diet</em> and <em>stress</em> but forgets <em>your own idea</em>.
</p>

<p>✅ Add a short extra paragraph, such as:</p>

<p><em>
  Another important factor is getting enough rest. Sleep helps the body recover and stay strong.
</em></p>

<p>
  Fixing content is more important than fixing commas. If your essay doesn’t answer the full
  question, your score drops immediately – no matter how beautiful the grammar.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Level 2: Grammar and Sentence Structure</h3>

<p>
  Now zoom in. Look for the mistakes that lower accuracy marks: verb forms, agreement, articles,
  and sentence control.
</p>

<p>Here’s a simple checklist.</p>

<h4>Verb tense</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are all verbs in the correct tense?</li>
  <li>
    Match tenses to time:<br>
    <em>last year</em> → past (<em>went</em>)<br>
    <em>now</em> → present (<em>go</em>)<br>
    <em>in the future</em> → <em>will go</em> / <em>are going to</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Subject–verb agreement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Does the verb match the subject?</li>
</ul>

<p>❌ <em>People enjoys doing exercise…</em><br>
✅ <em>People enjoy doing exercise…</em></p>

<h4>Articles</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are <em>a / an / the</em> used correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Use <strong>the</strong> for specific things, <strong>a/an</strong> for general ones.
</p>

<h4>Countable / uncountable nouns</h4>

<p>❌ <em>Informations</em> → ✅ <em>information</em></p>

<h4>Sentence length</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are any sentences too long or joined incorrectly?</li>
  <li>Split long sentences with a full stop or a semicolon.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Relative clauses</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are <em>who / which / that</em> used correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>People who recycle help the planet.</em></p>

<h4>If-clauses</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are conditional structures correct?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If people exercised more, they would feel healthier.</em></p>

<p>
  When editing, read slowly and “aloud in your head”. Your ear often catches mistakes your eyes
  miss.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>❌ <em>People enjoys doing exercise because it make them relax.</em><br>
✅ <em>People enjoy doing exercise because it makes them relax.</em></p>

<p>
  Tiny corrections like these immediately improve your accuracy.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Level 3: Vocabulary and Word Choice</h3>

<p>
  Next, look at your word choices. Are they appropriate for a Cambridge essay?
  Formal writing doesn’t need difficult words – just the right ones.
</p>

<p>Check for these five things:</p>

<h4>(a) Avoid informal or spoken words</h4>

<p>❌ <em>Kids these days don’t care about recycling.</em><br>
✅ <em>Many young people today do not care enough about recycling.</em></p>

<h4>(b) Replace “very + adjective”</h4>

<ul>
  <li>❌ very good → ✅ excellent</li>
  <li>❌ very bad → ✅ terrible</li>
  <li>❌ very important → ✅ essential / crucial</li>
</ul>

<h4>(c) Use variety instead of repetition</h4>

<p>❌ <em>important… important… important</em><br>
✅ <em>important… essential… significant</em></p>

<h4>(d) Check collocations (word combinations)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>❌ make a research → ✅ do / conduct research</li>
  <li>❌ strong rain → ✅ heavy rain</li>
</ul>

<h4>(e) Avoid vague words</h4>

<p>❌ <em>things, stuff, a lot of, nice</em><br>
✅ <em>issues, materials, many, beneficial</em></p>

<p>
  Each time you replace a vague or informal word with a precise one, you show control.
  That’s exactly what examiners mean by “range of vocabulary”.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Level 4: Punctuation and Spelling</h3>

<p>
  Now look at the technical side of writing. Punctuation doesn’t only mark pauses – it shows your
  reader how to read your ideas.
</p>

<h4>(a) Full stops</h4>

<p>
  Every sentence must end with one complete idea.
</p>

<p>❌ <em>I think exercise is important it helps people stay healthy.</em><br>
✅ <em>I think exercise is important. It helps people stay healthy.</em></p>

<h4>(b) Commas</h4>

<p>Use them to separate clauses or after linking phrases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>✅ <em>In my opinion, public transport should be free.</em></li>
  <li>✅ <em>Although it is expensive, many people still drive to work.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Avoid overusing commas – one per sentence is usually enough.
</p>

<h4>(c) Capital letters</h4>

<p>Start sentences and proper nouns with a capital:</p>

<p>✅ <em>The River Thames flows through London.</em></p>

<h4>(d) Spelling</h4>

<p><strong>Common tricky words:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>environment ✅ (not <em>enviroment</em>)</li>
  <li>government ✅ (not <em>goverment</em>)</li>
  <li>necessary ✅ (two s’s, one c)</li>
  <li>definitely ✅ (not <em>definately</em>)</li>
  <li>people ✅ (no <em>peoples</em> unless you mean nations)</li>
  <li>their / there / they’re → choose carefully</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the exam, you can’t use a spellchecker. So practise writing key words by hand – it trains your
  memory.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. How to Check Efficiently in Five Minutes</h3>

<p>Here’s a calm, systematic approach for your final five minutes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Paragraph 1 (Introduction):</strong><br>
    Does it answer the question?<br>
    Is your opinion clear?<br>
    No contractions (<em>don’t, can’t</em>)?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paragraphs 2–3 (Body):</strong><br>
    Each paragraph = one clear idea?<br>
    Linking words used naturally?<br>
    Grammar consistent?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paragraph 4 (Conclusion):</strong><br>
    Clear summary and final opinion?<br>
    Not introducing new information?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Whole essay:</strong><br>
    Word count roughly 140–190?<br>
    No obvious spelling or punctuation errors?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Use your pencil to underline or lightly mark errors. Then correct them neatly – legibility
  matters.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Editing Tricks for Speed</h3>

<p>
  Even when time is short, these small techniques make editing faster and smarter.
</p>

<h4>(a) Read backwards, sentence by sentence</h4>

<p>
  Start from the last sentence and move up.  
  It breaks the “flow” of reading and helps you notice grammar or spelling mistakes.
</p>

<h4>(b) Use your finger or pencil to guide your eyes</h4>

<p>
  Move slowly under each line. Your brain slows down and pays more attention.
</p>

<h4>(c) Circle linking words</h4>

<p>
  If you find too many <em>and / but / because</em>, replace one or two with more advanced connectors
  (<em>although, therefore, however</em>).
</p>

<h4>(d) Highlight verbs mentally</h4>

<p>
  Check if they all agree with the subject and stay in the same tense.  
  Small correction, big effect.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. The Most Common B2 Errors (and Quick Fixes)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Article misuse</strong><br>
    ❌ She is teacher. → ✅ She is <em>a</em> teacher.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wrong plural</strong><br>
    ❌ Many advices. → ✅ Much advice / many pieces of advice.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Preposition error</strong><br>
    ❌ Depend of → ✅ Depend on
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tense confusion</strong><br>
    ❌ Last year I go to London. → ✅ Last year I went to London.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Word order</strong><br>
    ❌ Always I study English. → ✅ I always study English.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Double subject</strong><br>
    ❌ My brother he likes football. → ✅ My brother likes football.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run-on sentence</strong><br>
    ❌ I was tired I went home. → ✅ I was tired, so I went home.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Missing “-s” in present simple</strong><br>
    ❌ He work hard. → ✅ He works hard.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Make this list part of your pre-exam revision.  
  If you fix just two or three of these during editing, your accuracy score rises noticeably.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>11. Self-Correction Strategies (Before the Exam)</h3>

<p>
  Editing is easier in the exam if you practise it during preparation. Try these habits:
</p>

<h4>(a) Keep an error notebook</h4>

<p>Write down your own most frequent mistakes and the correct forms.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>❌ people likes → ✅ people like</li>
  <li>❌ I am agree → ✅ I agree</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Look through it before every writing practice.
</p>

<h4>(b) Use colour when editing drafts</h4>

<p>
  In your practice essays at home, highlight grammar issues in one colour, vocabulary in another,
  and connectors in a third.  
  It trains your eyes to see patterns in your mistakes.
</p>

<h4>(c) Compare your writing to model answers</h4>

<p>
  Notice how the model uses transitions, punctuation, and tone.  
  Ask: <em>Does my version sound too casual or too mechanical?</em>
</p>

<h4>(d) Time yourself</h4>

<p>
  Practise editing under real exam conditions.  
  Try reading and correcting your essay in exactly five minutes.
</p>

<h3>12. Balancing Accuracy and Expression</h3>

<p>
  Accuracy is vital, but don’t let it stop your flow. Some students become so afraid of making
  mistakes that they write slowly, using only safe words. That limits your Language Range score.
</p>

<p><strong>The balance is this:</strong></p>

<p><em>In the exam, write freely first — then edit carefully.</em></p>

<p>
  Your first draft shows your creativity.  
  Your edits show your control.  
  Together, they make you sound confident and natural.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>13. Practice: Edit Like an Examiner</h3>

<p>Try this short exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Student version:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  People today is very busy, they hasn’t time to cook. Because of this they eat fastfood, it is bad
  for health. The goverment should do something.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Step-by-step edit:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Grammar check → <em>People today are very busy; they don’t have time to cook.</em></li>
  <li>Punctuation → join correctly:  
    <em>Because of this, they eat fast food, which is bad for their health.</em></li>
  <li>Spelling → <em>goverment</em> → <em>government</em>.</li>
  <li>Style → more formal tone:  
    <em>The government should take action to improve eating habits.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edited version:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  People today are very busy and often do not have time to cook. As a result, they eat fast food,
  which is bad for their health. The government should take action to improve eating habits.
</em></p>

<p>
  This is the kind of calm, corrected writing examiners love – clear, controlled, and accurate.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>14. What Examiners Notice When You Edit</h3>

<p>
  Cambridge examiners read quickly, but they can tell when a student has edited their work.  
  They notice:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear punctuation and paragraph spacing;</li>
  <li>few repeated errors (shows awareness);</li>
  <li>balanced tone and consistent tenses;</li>
  <li>neat corrections (not messy crossings-out).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Editing doesn’t just clean your essay – it communicates professionalism.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>15. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
  Editing is the quiet strength behind every good writer.  
  It’s not dramatic, but it’s powerful.  
  It’s the final handshake between your ideas and your reader.
</p>

<p>
  When you edit, you say:  
  <em>“I respect my writing enough to polish it.”</em>  
  And that respect shows in every line.
</p>

<p>
  So before you put down your pen in the exam, breathe. Read your essay once more. Listen to its
  rhythm. Fix what sounds wrong. Trust your instincts.
</p>

<p><strong>Because in the end:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Planning gives structure. Writing gives meaning. Editing gives quality.
</em></p>

<p>
  In the next unit, we’ll move forward to
  <strong>Unit 12: Building Confidence and Time Management</strong>, where you’ll learn how to stay calm,
  focused, and efficient in the real exam – using every minute wisely to produce your best possible
  writing under pressure.
