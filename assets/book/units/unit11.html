    <!-- 1. Why editing matters -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u11-why-editing">
      <h2>1. Why Editing Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Even excellent ideas lose power when they are hidden under small mistakes. Grammar slips, missing commas,
        or repeated words can make a strong essay look careless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Editing is your chance to catch those small errors before the examiner does. It is also a way to show
        maturity: you do not panic; you check your work like a professional.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Writing shows your ideas. Editing shows your control.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners value accuracy highly. A student who writes clearly, even with simple language,
        often scores higher than one who uses advanced words incorrectly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. How much time to spend -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u11-time">
      <h2>2. How Much Time to Spend</h2>

      <p>
        You have about <strong>five minutes</strong> at the end of your essay for editing. That is enough – if you use
        it well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those five minutes can easily improve your mark by half a band, sometimes even a full band.
        Plan your timing like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>5–7 minutes to plan</li>
        <li>25 minutes to write</li>
        <li>5 minutes to check and polish</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is not to rewrite everything, but to correct what weakens your essay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Four levels -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u11-levels">
      <h2>3. The Four Levels of Editing</h2>

      <p>To edit efficiently, follow this order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Content and organisation</strong> – Is everything clear and complete?</li>
        <li><strong>Grammar and sentence structure</strong> – Are tenses and agreement correct?</li>
        <li><strong>Vocabulary and word choice</strong> – Are words appropriate, precise, and formal?</li>
        <li><strong>Punctuation and spelling</strong> – Are commas, full stops, and capitals correct?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We will go through each level one by one.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Level 1: Content and organisation -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u11-level1">
      <h2>4. Level 1: Content and Organisation</h2>

      <p>
        Before checking small details, make sure your essay answers the task. Ask yourself:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Did I include all three notes from the question?</li>
        <li>Did I give my opinion clearly?</li>
        <li>Does each paragraph have one clear idea?</li>
        <li>Does the essay flow logically from beginning to end?</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example of a missing note</h3>
        <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> An essay about health that covers <em>diet</em> and <em>stress</em> but forgets
          <em>your own idea</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add a short extra paragraph:</p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Another important factor is getting enough rest. Sleep helps the body recover and stay strong.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Fixing content is more important than fixing commas. If your essay does not answer the full question,
        your score drops immediately – no matter how beautiful the grammar is.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u11-level2">
      <h2>5. Level 2: Grammar and Sentence Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Now zoom in. Look for the mistakes that lower your accuracy marks: verb forms, agreement, articles,
        and sentence control.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.1 Verb tense</h3>
        <p>Check that all verbs match the time you mean:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Last year</strong> → past</li>
          <li><strong>now / these days</strong> → present</li>
          <li><strong>in the future</strong> → will / going to</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.2 Subject–verb agreement</h3>
        <p>Does the verb match the subject?</p>
        <p class="example">
          ✅ People <strong>like</strong> online shopping.<br>
          ❌ People <strong>likes</strong> online shopping.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- ARTICLES (ANCHOR) -->
      <article class="definition-card" id="u11-articles">
        <h3>5.3 Articles: a / an / the</h3>
        <p>
          Articles are small but important. Use <strong>a / an</strong> for general, non-specific things, and
          <strong>the</strong> for specific things you and the reader both know.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ✅ She is <strong>a</strong> teacher.<br>
          ✅ The teacher in my class is very strict.<br>
          ❌ She is teacher.
        </p>

        <p>
          When editing, quickly scan for nouns and ask: “Do I need <em>a/an</em> here? Or <em>the</em>?”
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- UNCOUNTABLE (ANCHOR) -->
      <article class="definition-card" id="u11-uncountable">
        <h3>5.4 Countable and uncountable nouns</h3>
        <p>
          Some nouns are <strong>uncountable</strong> in English (e.g. <em>information, advice, homework</em>).
          They do not take <em>-s</em> in the singular.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ❌ Many <strong>informations</strong>.<br>
          ✅ A lot of <strong>information</strong>.<br>
          ✅ Many pieces of <strong>information</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When editing, circle any uncountable nouns and check that you have not used a plural form.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.5 Sentence length and structure</h3>
        <p>
          Are any sentences too long or joined incorrectly? Split long, confusing sentences into two
          clearer ones.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ❌ I think exercise is important it helps people stay healthy.<br>
          ✅ I think exercise is important. It helps people stay healthy.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- RELATIVE PRONOUNS (ANCHOR) -->
      <article class="definition-card" id="u11-relative-pronouns">
        <h3>5.6 Relative clauses (who / which / that)</h3>
        <p>
          Use <strong>who</strong> for people, <strong>which</strong> for things, and <strong>that</strong> for
          both in many informal cases.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ✅ People <strong>who</strong> recycle help the planet.<br>
          ✅ The programme <strong>which / that</strong> I watched was very interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          When editing, check each <em>who/which/that</em>: does it refer to the right noun?
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- CONDITIONALS (ANCHOR) -->
      <article class="definition-card" id="u11-conditionals">
        <h3>5.7 If-clauses and conditionals</h3>
        <p>
          Conditional sentences have two parts: the <strong>if-clause</strong> and the <strong>result clause</strong>.
          Make sure the tense combination is correct.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ✅ If people <strong>exercised</strong> more, they <strong>would feel</strong> healthier. (second conditional)<br>
          ✅ If more people <strong>use</strong> public transport, cities <strong>will become</strong> less polluted. (first conditional)
        </p>

        <p>
          When editing, quickly scan for “if” and check that the tenses on both sides match the pattern you want.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>5.8 Listening to your sentences</h3>
        <p>
          When editing, read slowly and “aloud in your head”. Your ear often catches mistakes that your eyes miss.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ❌ People enjoys doing exercise because it make them relax.<br>
          ✅ People enjoy doing exercise because it makes them relax.

      <h2>6. Level 3: Vocabulary and Word Choice</h2>

      <p>
        Next, look at your word choices. Are they appropriate for a Cambridge essay?
        Formal writing does not need difficult words – just the <strong>right</strong> ones.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>6.1 Avoid informal or spoken words</h3>
        <p class="example">

        </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>6.2 Replace “very + adjective”</h3>

          ❌ very important → ✅ essential / crucial

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>6.3 Add variety instead of repetition</h3>

          ❌ important… important… important…<br>
          ✅ important… essential… significant…
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>6.4 Check collocations (natural word combinations)</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ make a research → ✅ do / conduct research<br>
          ❌ strong rain → ✅ heavy rain
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>6.5 Avoid vague words</h3>

          ❌ things, stuff, a lot of, nice<br>
          ✅ issues, materials, many, beneficial
        </p>

        <p>
          Each time you replace a vague or informal word with a precise one, you show control.
          That is what examiners mean by “range of vocabulary”.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraph 1 (Introduction):</strong> Does it answer the question? Is your opinion clear?
          No contractions (don’t, can’t)?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraphs 2–3 (Body):</strong> Does each paragraph have one clear idea?
          Are linking words used naturally? Is grammar consistent?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paragraph 4 (Conclusion):</strong> Clear summary and final opinion?
          No new information?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole essay:</strong> Word count roughly 140–190? No obvious spelling or punctuation errors?

        Editing is easier in the exam if you practise it during preparation. Try these habits:
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>11.1 Keep an error notebook</h3>
        <p>
          Write down your most frequent mistakes and the correct forms.
        </p>

        <p class="example">
          ❌ people likes → ✅ people like<br>
          ❌ I am agree → ✅ I agree
        </p>

        <p>Look through your notebook before every writing practice.</p>

        <h3>11.2 Use colour when editing drafts</h3>
        <p>
          At home, highlight grammar issues in one colour, vocabulary in another, and connectors in a third.
          This trains your eyes to <strong>see patterns</strong> in your mistakes.

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>11.3 Compare your writing to model answers</h3>
        <p>
          Notice how the model uses transitions, punctuation, and tone. Ask:
          “Does my version sound too casual or too mechanical?”
        </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>11.4 Time yourself</h3>
        <p>
          Practise editing under real exam conditions. Try reading and correcting your essay in exactly five minutes.

      <h2>12. Balancing Accuracy and Expression</h2>

      <p>
        Accuracy is vital, but do not let it stop your flow. Some students become so afraid of making mistakes
        that they write very slowly, using only safe words. That limits your <strong>Language Range</strong> score.
      </p>

      <p>
        The balance is this: in the exam, <strong>write freely first – then edit carefully</strong>.
        Your first draft shows your creativity. Your edits show your control. Together, they make you sound
        confident and natural.

      <h2>14. What Examiners Notice When You Edit</h2>

      <p>
        Cambridge examiners read quickly, but they can tell when a student has edited their work. They notice:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>clear punctuation and paragraph spacing,</li>
        <li>few repeated errors (shows awareness),</li>
        <li>balanced tone and consistent tenses,</li>
        <li>neat corrections (not messy crossings-out).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Editing does not just clean your essay – it communicates professionalism.

      <h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Editing is the quiet strength behind every good writer. It is not dramatic, but it is powerful.
        It is the final handshake between your ideas and your reader.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Planning gives structure.<br>
        Writing gives meaning.<br>
        Editing gives quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you edit, you say: “I respect my writing enough to polish it.” That respect shows in every line.
        Before you put down your pen in the exam, breathe. Read your essay once more. Listen to its rhythm.
        Fix what sounds wrong. Trust your instincts.
