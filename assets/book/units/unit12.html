      <h2>1. The Real Challenge in the Writing Exam</h2>

      <p>
        When I ask my students what makes writing difficult, they often say:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I don’t know what to write.”</li>
        <li>“I’m afraid of making mistakes.”</li>
        <li>“I can’t finish on time.”</li>
        <li>“I panic when the clock starts.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Do these sound familiar? The good news is that these are <strong>not</strong> language problems.
        They are <strong>process problems</strong>. And that means they can be fixed with simple strategies
        and practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s start by changing the way we think about exam writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Mindset -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u12-mindset">
      <h2>2. The Mindset of a Confident Writer</h2>

      <p>
        A confident writer does not feel panic because they know what to do, step by step.
        They follow a plan, they trust their structure, and they stay calm when time passes quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Confidence does not mean never feeling nervous. It means recognising your nerves – and
        knowing how to handle them.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Confidence grows from preparation, not from perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you know exactly what each stage of the exam requires, you free your brain to focus on ideas,
        not fear.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Timing breakdown -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u12-timing">
      <h2>3. The Cambridge Essay Timing Breakdown</h2>

      <p>
        The B2 essay gives you about <strong>40 minutes</strong>. Here is a realistic, proven plan to use
        those minutes wisely:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Read and understand the question</strong> – identify key words and the three notes.
          (2–3 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plan your ideas</strong> – choose your opinion and main points. (5 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Write your essay</strong> – follow your paragraph plan. (25 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edit and check</strong> – correct grammar, word choice, and flow. (5–7 minutes)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        That is it – calm, organised, predictable. If you follow this routine during practice, it will feel
        natural in the exam.

    <section class="unit-section" id="u12-stage1">
      <h2>4. Stage 1 – Reading the Question Carefully</h2>

      <p>
        It may sound obvious, but the biggest reason students lose marks is because they do not answer
        the question fully. They rush. They read the first line and start writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Result? They miss a note or misunderstand the topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always take two deep breaths and read everything twice.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>What to mark in the task</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Circle or underline the <strong>main question</strong>.</li>
          <li>Circle the <strong>three notes</strong>.</li>
          <li>Underline key verbs such as <em>discuss, explain, give reasons</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">

          <li>1. money</li>
          <li>2. advertising</li>
          <li>3. your own idea</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Topic:</strong> health, sugar</li>
          <li><strong>Question:</strong> Is eating less sugar the best way to stay healthy?</li>

      <h2>5. Stage 2 – Planning Quickly but Clearly</h2>

      <p>
        You learned in <strong>Unit 10</strong> how to make a strong plan in five minutes.
        Here is how to do it efficiently in the exam:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Write your main opinion in one clear sentence.<br>
          <span class="example"><em>
            “Eating less sugar is important, but it is not the only way to stay healthy.”
          </em></span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Write one short phrase for each paragraph:
          <ul>
            <li>Paragraph 1: money – healthy food costs more</li>
            <li>Paragraph 2: advertising – unhealthy products heavily promoted</li>
            <li>Paragraph 3: own idea – exercise equally important</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Visualise your structure: <strong>Introduction → 3 paragraphs → Conclusion</strong>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Your plan should take no more than half a page of notes – neat and simple.
        Do not write complete sentences. Just notes to guide you.

      <h2>6. Stage 3 – Writing Efficiently and Calmly</h2>

      <p>
        Here is the secret to finishing on time: <strong>do not aim for perfection while writing</strong>.
        Get your ideas down first. You can correct them later.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Tips for efficient writing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tip 1:</strong> Use two clear body paragraphs before the conclusion.
            Three short, clear paragraphs are better than two long, confused ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tip 2:</strong> Keep your sentences balanced – about 4–5 sentences per paragraph is enough
            for development and examples.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tip 3:</strong> Follow your PEEL structure automatically.
            When you feel nervous, repeat in your mind:
            <em>Point – Evidence – Explain – Link</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tip 4:</strong> Do not stop to erase or rewrite whole sentences.
            Cross out lightly and move on. You will edit later.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        Writing is not about having perfect thoughts – it is about keeping momentum.

      <h2>7. Stage 4 – Editing and Checking (Your 5-Minute Power Stage)</h2>

      <p>
        In <strong>Unit 11</strong>, you learned how to edit for grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation.
        Now let’s apply it under exam conditions.
      </p>

      <p>Here is a mini-checklist you can keep in your head:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Did I include all three notes?</li>
        <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Is my view clear?</li>
        <li><strong>Organisation:</strong> Are there clear paragraphs and connectors?</li>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> Any repeated errors (verb forms, articles, spelling)?</li>
        <li><strong>Word count:</strong> Around 160–190 words?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you find small grammar slips, correct them quickly and move on. Do not panic about tiny details.
        Five well-chosen corrections can lift your mark – but rewriting everything can waste time.

      <h2>8. The Calm-Writing Technique</h2>

      <p>
        When the exam starts, adrenaline will rise – that is natural. The trick is to turn that energy into focus.
      </p>

      <p>Try this before you begin writing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sit up straight.</li>
        <li>Place both feet flat on the floor.</li>
        <li>Breathe in slowly for four seconds, breathe out for four.</li>
        <li>Tell yourself quietly: <em>“I know what to do. One step at a time.”</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It sounds simple, but it changes your brain. It tells your body:
        <em>This is not danger – it is a task.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Nerves are not your enemy. They are just energy. You can use that energy to write with purpose.

      <ol>
        <li>Choose one essay question.</li>

        <li>Stop exactly at 40 minutes – even if you are not finished.</li>

      <p>
        When you review later, ask:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <h3>13.1 Avoid underlength (too short)</h3>
        <p>
          Under-length essays are often the result of spending too long planning or writing very slowly
          because of perfectionism.

        <h3>13.2 Avoid overlength (too long)</h3>

          Over-length essays usually come from trying to say everything. This can create timing problems

      <h2>14. Build Confidence with “Mini Wins”</h2>

      <p>
        Confidence grows through small successes, not one big one. After each practice essay,
        write down one thing you did well.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I used ‘although’ and ‘therefore’ correctly.”</li>
        <li>“I remembered to give my opinion in the introduction.”</li>
        <li>“My word count was perfect.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Small wins train your brain to notice progress. And progress builds confidence more effectively
        than chasing perfection.

      <h2>15. What Confidence Feels Like</h2>

      <p>
        Confidence does not mean your essay is perfect. It means you finish with calm satisfaction
        because you know you did your best.
      </p>

      <p>
        A confident Cambridge writer:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>follows a clear structure,</li>
        <li>uses safe, accurate grammar,</li>
        <li>gives logical arguments,</li>
        <li>and finishes within the time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Confidence is quiet. It is not loud, and it does not rush. It is steady, focused, and kind to itself.

      <h2>16. Reflection: Control the Controllables</h2>

      <p>
        In the exam, some things are outside your control – the topic, the temperature, the noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        But many things are within your control:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>your preparation,</li>
        <li>your structure,</li>
        <li>your planning,</li>
        <li>your breathing,</li>
        <li>your time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Focus on what you <strong>can</strong> control, and let go of the rest. That is how professionals
        approach pressure – with calm, not perfectionism.

      <h2>17. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        You have now reached the final step of Part 3. You know how to plan, write, edit, and manage your time.
        You have built not only skill but also <strong>composure</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the exam day arrives, remember: you are not just writing an essay – you are demonstrating
        calm thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examiners recognise calmness. They can feel it in your sentences, your transitions, your tone.
        And that calm confidence is what turns good writing into great writing.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        So before the exam, take one last deep breath and say to yourself:<br>
        <em>“I know what to do. I’ve practised it. Now I’ll just write.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next part, we will begin <strong>Part 4: Writing for Cambridge C1 Advanced</strong>,
        where you will learn how to move beyond the B2 structure – developing more depth, flexibility,
        and sophistication to match the higher-level descriptors of the C1 essay task.

      <section class="unit-section" id="u12-summary">
  <h2>13. Summary & Quick Reference</h2>

  <p>Unit 12 focused on <strong>timing, confidence, and managing the word limit</strong> — three skills that often make the difference between a B2 pass and a high score. Use this page as a fast checklist before or during timed practice.</p>

  <h3>✔ Ideal Word Count Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recommended length:</strong> 160–190 words for B2.</li>
    <li><strong>Under-length:</strong> usually missing development or examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-length:</strong> often includes unnecessary repetition or irrelevant detail.</li>
    <li><strong>Best practice:</strong> Aim for <strong>175–185 words</strong> — safe and comfortable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✔ Why Timing Matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The exam is short — you must plan, write, and edit efficiently.</li>
    <li>Poor timing leads to weak endings, unfinished ideas, or no editing pass.</li>
    <li>A simple routine helps control stress and increases clarity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✔ The 6–8–6 Routine (Fast B2 Timing Template)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>6 minutes → Planning:</strong> ideas, structure, paragraph points.</li>
    <li><strong>8 minutes → Writing:</strong> follow the plan and keep sentences clear.</li>
    <li><strong>6 minutes → Editing:</strong> fix grammar, punctuation, connectors, and wordiness.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>This routine keeps your essay balanced, controlled, and safe within the word limit.</em></p>

  <h3>✔ Common Over-Length Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Too many examples that repeat the same idea.</li>
    <li>Sentences with unnecessary phrases (“at this point in time”, “the reason why is that”).</li>
    <li>Adding new ideas in the conclusion.</li>
    <li>Writing long explanations instead of short, clear ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✔ Common Under-Length Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ideas stated but not developed.</li>
    <li>No concrete example to support an argument.</li>
    <li>Very short topic sentences.</li>
    <li>Conclusion missing or too short.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✔ Quick Before–After Examples</h3>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Over-length → Concise</strong></p>
    <p>❌ <em>At this moment in time, young people are facing a lot of different kinds of problems...</em></p>
    <p>✅ <em>Today, young people face several problems...</em></p>
  </div>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Under-length → Developed</strong></p>
    <p>❌ <em>Social media is useful.</em></p>
    <p>✅ <em>Social media is useful because it helps students share resources and organise study groups.</em></p>
  </div>

  <h3>✔ Confidence Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use the same routine every time.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Write simple, clear sentences when stressed.</strong> (Clarity beats complexity.)</li>
    <li><strong>Plan first:</strong> It lowers stress and makes the writing stage faster.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust editing:</strong> The last 5–6 minutes can transform your score.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>A confident writer is a consistent writer. Build routines now, and the exam becomes predictable.</em></p>
