      When you reach the C1 level, the question is no longer
      <em>“Can you write in English?”</em> – it is
      <strong>“How well do you sound?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      By now, you already know how to plan, structure, and link ideas. But what truly
      separates C1 essays from B2 ones is <strong>style</strong> – how your writing
      <em>feels</em> to the reader.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will explore what makes a text sound naturally formal and confidently written.
      You will learn how to achieve elegance without exaggeration, balance without stiffness, and
      warmth without informality.

    <!-- 1. What style and tone mean -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-style">
      <h2>1. What Style and Tone Mean</h2>

      <p>Let us start with two key terms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Style</strong> – how you use language: sentence patterns, vocabulary,
          and structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tone</strong> – the attitude your writing communicates: respectful,
          confident, curious, cautious, balanced…
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In Cambridge essays, your goal is to achieve a
        <strong>formal academic style</strong> and a
        <strong>balanced, thoughtful tone</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This does not mean you must sound cold or distant. The best essays sound measured,
        clear, and genuinely human.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: <strong>Formality is not about sounding complicated – it is about sounding careful.</strong>

    <!-- 2. Voices -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-voices">
      <h2>2. The Three Voices of Academic Writing</h2>

      <p>
        At advanced level, we often talk about three main “voices” in English writing.
        Each one plays a role, but only one fits the Cambridge essay best.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Informal</h3>
        <p>Friendly, emotional, conversational.</p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          I think technology is great because it helps me every day!
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Neutral / Semi-formal</h3>
        <p>Calm, clear, suitable for general writing.</p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Technology helps people manage daily life more efficiently.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Formal</h3>
        <p>Objective, measured, used for academic writing.</p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Technological innovation has significantly improved daily efficiency for many people.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        For the C1 essay, your tone should be between
        <strong>neutral and formal</strong> – natural, not robotic.
        Too informal sounds careless. Too formal sounds artificial.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How to Sound Naturally Formal</h2>

      <p>
        Let us look at five practical ways to adjust your tone from B2-level to
        C1-level formality.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u16-contractions">
        <h3>3.1 Avoid contractions</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>don’t, can’t, won’t, it’s</em><br>
          ✅ <em>do not, cannot, will not, it is</em>

          Small details like this instantly raise your level of formality.
        </p>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u16-informal">
        <h3>3.2 Avoid slang and casual expressions</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>a lot of, kids, stuff, really good, gonna</em><br>
          ✅ <em>many, children, materials, extremely beneficial, going to</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>A lot of kids spend too much time on their phones.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>Many children spend excessive time on their mobile devices.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          You are still saying the same thing – just with more maturity.

      <article class="definition-card" id="u16-precise-lexis">
        <h3>3.3 Use precise, academic vocabulary</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid words that feel vague or emotional. Choose ones that are factual and specific.

      <article class="definition-card" id="u16-cautious-language">
        <h3>3.4 Use cautious, balanced language</h3>
        <p>
          At C1, you do not make extreme statements like
          <em>“Technology is always bad.”</em>
          You use softeners to show awareness of complexity.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Limiting:</strong> to some extent, in certain cases<br>
          <em>To some extent, working from home increases productivity.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Caution:</strong> it seems that, it appears that<br>
          <em>It appears that young people rely more on technology than older generations.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Balance:</strong> while this may be true, nevertheless<br>
          <em>While this may be true, it does not apply to all situations.</em>
        </p>

      <article class="definition-card" id="u16-overformal">
        <h3>3.5 Avoid over-formality</h3>
        <p>
          Some students go too far and sound unnatural.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>In the modern epoch, multitudinous individuals are encumbered by occupational dilemmas.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>In today’s world, many people struggle with work-related stress.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Over-formal writing feels heavy and artificial. Keep your language simple, but elegant.
          That is the real sign of confidence.

    <!-- 4. Formal grammar -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-grammar">
      <h2>4. Formal Grammar Constructions to Practise</h2>

      <p>
        Here are five grammar tools that add variety and professionalism to your essays –
        without sounding forced.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.1 The passive voice</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>It is widely believed that education improves equality.</em><br>
          <em>Governments are expected to invest in renewable energy.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the passive to focus on actions or results, not on people.
          Just do not overuse it – mix it with active sentences for rhythm.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.2 Impersonal “It” structures</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>It is important to recognise that mental health affects productivity.</em><br>
          <em>It could be argued that freedom of choice is more valuable than stability.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          These phrases create a balanced, academic tone. You can use them safely in
          introductions and conclusions.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.3 Nominalisation</h3>
        <p>
          Turning verbs into nouns can make your writing sound more academic.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>People argue that schools should motivate students.</em><br>
          → <em>There is an ongoing debate about student motivation in schools.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Nominalisation adds sophistication, but use it lightly – too many nominalisations
          can make your text sound abstract.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.4 Subordinate clauses for flexibility</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>Although technology improves efficiency, it also reduces privacy.</em><br>
          <em>While some people prefer stability, others value change.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          These structures show that you can handle complex grammar confidently.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.5 Parallel structure</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>True progress depends on equality, on innovation, and on education.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Balanced patterns like this make your writing sound polished and deliberate.

      <h2>5. Balancing Formality and Humanity</h2>

      <p id="u16-tone-balance">
        Many students worry that writing formally means losing their natural voice.
        But the best formal writing still feels human – thoughtful, calm, and clear.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Finding the sweet spot</h3>
        <p class="example">
          Too formal (cold):<br>
          <em>It is incontrovertible that environmental degradation is an urgent phenomenon requiring immediate rectification.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Too informal (casual):<br>
          <em>The environment is in big trouble, and we should do something fast.</em>

        <p class="example">
          Balanced (C1 tone):<br>
          <em>Environmental damage is a serious issue that requires immediate and coordinated action.</em>
        </p>

          That is the sweet spot – professional, yet warm and readable.

      <h2>6. Using Modality for Softness and Precision</h2>

      <p>
        Modal verbs are excellent tools for sounding mature and polite. They help you express

        Good rhythm keeps your writing readable and persuasive.
      </p>

      <p>When editing, try this simple pattern:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow every long sentence with a shorter one.</li>
        <li>Vary the opening of your sentences – do not always start with “It” or “There”.</li>
        <li>Read your essay aloud softly; if it sounds heavy, simplify.</li>

        Many people believe that working from home improves efficiency because employees can

      <h2>11. Practice: Adjust the Tone</h2>

      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Rewrite these sentences in a natural, formal tone.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I think people should eat better food.</li>
        <li>Lots of people use cars every day.</li>
        <li>We should do something about pollution.</li>
        <li>Technology is getting really important these days.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>✅ Possible answers:</strong></p>

      <p class="example"><em>
        It is important for individuals to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet.<br>
        Many individuals rely on private cars for daily transport.<br>
        Measures should be taken to address environmental pollution.<br>
        Technology is playing an increasingly significant role in modern society.

      <p>
        All of these sound calm, objective, and advanced.

      <h2>12. Editing Your Essay for Tone</h2>

      <p>
        After you finish writing, take one minute to check for tone. Ask yourself:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Did I use contractions or informal words?</li>
        <li>Does my writing sound polite and objective?</li>
        <li>Are my sentences too long or too stiff?</li>
        <li>Would a teacher or examiner enjoy reading this?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If the answer is “yes”, your tone is probably right for C1.

      <h2>14. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        At C1 level, formality is not about hiding your voice. It is about
        <strong>refining</strong> it – shaping it into something polished, confident, and trustworthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you write with natural formality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your ideas sound credible.</li>
        <li>Your tone feels balanced.</li>
        <li>Your message becomes persuasive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        Remember: <strong>Formality is not distance – it is respect.</strong><br>
        You respect your reader, your subject, and your own writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        So before you finish your essay, read it once more and ask:
        <em>“Does this sound like something I would be proud to sign my name to?”</em>
        If the answer is yes, your tone is exactly where it should be.
      </p>
