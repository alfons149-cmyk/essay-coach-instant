<h2>Unit 16: Style, Tone, and Natural Formality</h2>

<p>
When you reach the C1 level, the question is no longer simply <em>“Can you write in English?”</em>  
It becomes: <strong>“How well do you sound?”</strong>
</p>

<p>
By now, you already know how to plan, structure, and link ideas. But what truly separates C1 essays
from B2 ones is <strong>style and tone</strong> — how your writing feels to the reader.
</p>

<p>
In this unit, we explore what makes a text sound naturally formal and confidently written. You’ll
learn how to achieve elegance without exaggeration, balance without stiffness, and warmth without
informality.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. What Style and Tone Mean</h3>

<p><strong>Style</strong> is how you use language — your sentence patterns, vocabulary, and structure.</p>

<p><strong>Tone</strong> is the attitude your writing communicates — respectful, confident, curious,
cautious, or balanced.</p>

<p>
In Cambridge essays, your goal is a <strong>formal academic style</strong> with a
<strong>balanced, thoughtful tone</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean you must sound cold or distant.  
The best essays sound measured, clear, and genuinely human.
</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong>  
Formality is not about sounding complicated — it is about sounding careful.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Three Voices of Academic Writing</h3>

<p>
At advanced level, we often talk about three main “voices” in English writing. Each one has a role,
but only one fits the Cambridge essay best.
</p>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Voice</th>
    <th>Characteristics</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Informal</strong></td>
    <td>Friendly, emotional, conversational.</td>
    <td><em>I think technology is great because it helps me every day!</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Neutral / Semi-formal</strong></td>
    <td>Calm, clear, suitable for general writing.</td>
    <td><em>Technology helps people manage daily life more efficiently.</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Formal</strong></td>
    <td>Objective, measured, used for academic writing.</td>
    <td><em>Technological innovation has significantly improved daily efficiency for many people.</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
For the C1 essay, your tone should sit between <strong>neutral and formal</strong> — natural, not robotic.
</p>

<p>
Too informal sounds careless.  
Too formal sounds artificial.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. How to Sound Naturally Formal</h3>

<p>
Here are five practical ways to move from B2-level to C1-level formality without losing your voice.
</p>

<h4>(1) Avoid contractions</h4>

<p>In formal exam writing, avoid forms like:</p>

<p><strong>❌</strong> don’t, can’t, won’t, it’s  
<strong>✅</strong> do not, cannot, will not, it is</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>❌</strong> It’s important that people don’t waste time online.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> It is important that people do not waste time online.</p>
</div>

<p>Small details like this instantly raise your level.</p>

<h4>(2) Avoid slang and casual expressions</h4>

<p>Replace vague or chatty words with more precise alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>❌</strong> a lot of, kids, stuff, really good, gonna  
<strong>✅</strong> many, children, materials, extremely beneficial, going to</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>❌</strong> A lot of kids spend too much time on their phones.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Many children spend excessive time on their mobile devices.</p>
</div>

<p>You are still saying the same thing — just with more maturity.</p>

<h4>(3) Use precise, academic vocabulary</h4>

<p>
Avoid very general verbs and adjectives (think, good, bad, people, things, say, show) and aim for
more specific choices.
</p>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Basic word</th>
    <th>More precise / academic options</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>think</td>
    <td>believe, consider, argue, maintain</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>good</td>
    <td>beneficial, useful, positive, advantageous</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bad</td>
    <td>harmful, negative, problematic, detrimental</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>people</td>
    <td>individuals, citizens, consumers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>things</td>
    <td>factors, issues, aspects, elements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>say</td>
    <td>state, suggest, claim, argue</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>show</td>
    <td>demonstrate, illustrate, reveal, indicate</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>❌</strong> It’s a good idea for people to travel.</p>
  <p><strong>✅</strong> Travelling can be highly beneficial, as it broadens individuals’ perspectives.</p>
</div>

<h4>(4) Use cautious, balanced language</h4>

<p>
At C1, you avoid absolute claims like <em>“Technology is always bad.”</em>  
Instead, you use softeners that show awareness of complexity:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>it seems that…</li>
  <li>it appears that…</li>
  <li>to some extent…</li>
  <li>in certain cases…</li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example (caution):</strong></p>
  <p>It appears that young people rely more on technology than older generations.</p>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example (balance):</strong></p>
  <p>While this may be true, it does not apply to all situations.</p>
</div>

<p>This kind of phrasing sounds intelligent and realistic — perfect for a Cambridge essay.</p>

<h4>(5) Avoid over-formality</h4>

<p>Some students go too far and end up sounding unnatural:</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>❌ Over-formal:</strong></p>
  <p>In the modern epoch, multitudinous individuals are encumbered by occupational dilemmas.</p>

  <p><strong>✅ Balanced C1:</strong></p>
  <p>In today’s world, many people struggle with work-related stress.</p>
</div>

<p>
Over-formal writing feels heavy and artificial.  
Keep your language simple, but elegant — that is the real sign of confidence.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Formal Grammar Constructions to Practise</h3>

<p>
Here are five grammar tools that add variety and professionalism to your essays — without sounding
forced.
</p>

<h4>(a) Passive voice (for formality and focus)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It is widely believed that education improves equality.</li>
  <li>Governments are expected to invest in renewable energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the passive to focus on actions or results, not on who does them. Do not overuse it — mix with active sentences for rhythm.</p>

<h4>(b) Impersonal “it” structures</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It is important to recognise that mental health affects productivity.</li>
  <li>It could be argued that freedom of choice is more valuable than stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>These create a balanced, academic tone. They are especially useful in introductions and conclusions.</p>

<h4>(c) Nominalisation (turning verbs into nouns)</h4>

<p>
Instead of: <em>People argue that schools should motivate students.</em><br>
You can write: <em>There is an ongoing debate about student motivation in schools.</em>
</p>

<p>
Nominalisation adds sophistication, but use it lightly — too many abstract nouns can make your
writing heavy.
</p>

<h4>(d) Subordinate clauses for flexibility</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Although technology improves efficiency, it also reduces privacy.</li>
  <li>While some people prefer stability, others value change.</li>
</ul>

<p>These structures show you can handle complex grammar confidently.</p>

<h4>(e) Parallel structure (for emphasis)</h4>

<p>Parallel patterns sound deliberate and polished:</p>

<p><em>True progress depends on equality, on innovation, and on education.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Balancing Formality and Humanity</h3>

<p>
Many students worry that writing formally means losing their natural voice.  
But the best formal writing still feels human — thoughtful, calm, and clear.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Too formal (cold):</strong></p>
  <p>It is incontrovertible that environmental degradation is an urgent phenomenon requiring immediate rectification.</p>

  <p><strong>Too informal (casual):</strong></p>
  <p>The environment is in big trouble, and we should do something fast.</p>

  <p><strong>Balanced (C1 tone):</strong></p>
  <p>Environmental damage is a serious issue that requires immediate and coordinated action.</p>
</div>

<p>That is the sweet spot — professional, yet warm and readable.</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Using Modality for Softness and Precision</h3>

<p>
Modal verbs are excellent tools for sounding mature and polite.  
They help you express degrees of certainty instead of strong absolutes.
</p>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Modals</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Suggestion</td>
    <td>could, might, may</td>
    <td>Governments could support local initiatives to reduce pollution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Probability</td>
    <td>should, will probably</td>
    <td>This policy should improve access to education.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Caution</td>
    <td>might not, may not</td>
    <td>Online education may not suit every learner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Necessity</td>
    <td>must, need to</td>
    <td>We must address climate change immediately.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Mixing modals lets you show nuance — the key to academic voice.</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Tone in Paragraphs: Confident but Calm</h3>

<p>Let’s see how tone can transform a paragraph.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>B2-level paragraph:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Many people use social media. It helps them talk to friends. But sometimes they spend too much
    time on it. This is not healthy.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>C1-level rewrite (natural formality):</strong></p>
  <p>
    Social media allows people to stay connected and share information instantly. However, excessive
    use can lead to dependency and distraction. For this reason, users need to find a balance between
    online interaction and real-life communication.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Notice how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tone is calm and neutral,</li>
  <li>vocabulary is more precise,</li>
  <li>sentences are longer but not wordy,</li>
  <li>and transitions sound natural.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is what natural formality looks like.</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Sounding Polite and Objective</h3>

<p>Cambridge essays should never sound aggressive or emotional. Even when you disagree, do so respectfully.</p>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Impolite / Too direct</th>
    <th>Polite / Formal</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Everyone knows this.</td>
    <td>It is commonly believed that…</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I don’t agree.</td>
    <td>That view is not entirely convincing. / I would argue that…</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>People must stop being lazy.</td>
    <td>Individuals should take more personal responsibility.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That idea is wrong.</td>
    <td>This view can be questioned.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Your goal is to convince the reader through logic, not emotion.  
Politeness shows intellectual maturity.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Stylistic Rhythm and Flow</h3>

<p>
Advanced writing is not only about what you say — it is about <strong>how it sounds</strong>.
Good rhythm keeps your writing readable and persuasive.
</p>

<p>Try this simple pattern when editing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Follow every long sentence with a shorter one.</li>
  <li>Vary the opening of your sentences — do not always start with “It” or “There”.</li>
  <li>Read your essay aloud softly; if it sounds heavy, simplify.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your ear is your best editor.</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. Vocabulary for a Formal Tone</h3>

<p>Here is a short collection of words that add natural formality without exaggeration.</p>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Basic</th>
    <th>More formal / precise</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>good</td>
    <td>beneficial, practical, valuable, advantageous</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bad</td>
    <td>harmful, negative, problematic, undesirable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>show</td>
    <td>demonstrate, illustrate, reveal, indicate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>think</td>
    <td>believe, argue, maintain, suggest</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>help</td>
    <td>support, encourage, facilitate, promote</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>get</td>
    <td>obtain, receive, achieve, experience</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>use</td>
    <td>employ, apply, make use of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>need</td>
    <td>require, be necessary for</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>start</td>
    <td>initiate, begin, launch</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>end</td>
    <td>conclude, complete, terminate</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Use these selectively. The goal is clarity with confidence, not complexity.</p>

<hr>

<h3>11. Practice: Adjust the Tone</h3>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Rewrite these sentences in a natural, formal tone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think people should eat better food.</li>
  <li>Lots of people use cars every day.</li>
  <li>We should do something about pollution.</li>
  <li>Technology is getting really important these days.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>It is important for individuals to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet.</li>
  <li>Many individuals rely on private cars for daily transport.</li>
  <li>Measures should be taken to address environmental pollution.</li>
  <li>Technology is playing an increasingly significant role in modern society.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these sound calm, objective, and advanced.</p>

<hr>

<h3>12. Editing Your Essay for Tone</h3>

<p>After you finish writing, take one minute to check your tone. Ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did I use any contractions or informal words?</li>
  <li>Does my writing sound polite and objective?</li>
  <li>Are any of my sentences too long or too stiff?</li>
  <li>Would a teacher or examiner enjoy reading this?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is yes, your tone is probably right.</p>

<hr>

<h3>13. Common Style Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)</h3>

<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th>Mistake</th>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Better</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixing informal with formal</td>
    <td>People should not be lazy when it comes to studying languages.</td>
    <td>Learners should take greater responsibility for their language development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overusing “very”</td>
    <td>very big, very nice, very important</td>
    <td>huge, pleasant, crucial</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Using emotional language</td>
    <td>It’s a disaster for young people!</td>
    <td>This situation is challenging for many young people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Too robotic</td>
    <td>It is considered that education is important.</td>
    <td>Education is widely regarded as essential.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Balance is everything: write as if you were explaining your ideas to an intelligent stranger —
clearly, calmly, and kindly.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>14. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
At C1 level, formality is not about hiding your voice.  
It is about refining it — shaping it into something polished, confident, and trustworthy.
</p>

<p>When you write with natural formality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your ideas sound credible.</li>
  <li>Your tone feels balanced.</li>
  <li>Your message becomes persuasive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Formality is not distance — it is respect: for your reader, your subject, and your own writing.
</p>

<p>
Before you finish your essay, read it once more and ask:<br>
<strong>“Does this sound like something I would be proud to sign my name to?”</strong>
</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, your tone is exactly where it should be.</p>

<p>
In the next unit, we move to <strong>Unit 17: Editing for Style and Precision</strong>, where you will
learn how to revise your writing at an advanced level — cutting repetition, tightening expression,
and polishing your essay until every sentence feels deliberate and strong.
