    <h1>Style, Tone, and Natural Formality</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      When you reach the C1 level, the question is no longer simply
      <em>“Can you write in English?”</em> It becomes:
      <strong>“How well do you sound?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      By now, you already know how to plan, structure, and link ideas. But what truly separates C1 essays
      from B2 ones is <strong>style and tone</strong> — how your writing feels to the reader.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we explore what makes a text sound naturally formal and confidently written. You will
      learn how to achieve elegance without exaggeration, balance without stiffness, and warmth without
      informality.

      <h2>1. What Style and Tone Mean</h2>

      <p><strong>Style</strong> is how you use language — your sentence patterns, vocabulary, and structure.</p>

      <p><strong>Tone</strong> is the attitude your writing communicates — respectful, confident, curious,
        cautious, or balanced.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Cambridge essays, your goal is a <strong>formal academic style</strong> with a
        <strong>balanced, thoughtful tone</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This does not mean you must sound cold or distant.
        The best essays sound measured, clear, and genuinely human.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
        Formality is not about sounding complicated — it is about sounding careful.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-three-voices">
      <h2>2. The Three Voices of Academic Writing</h2>

      <p>
        At advanced level, we often talk about three main “voices” in English writing. Each one has a role,
        but only one fits the Cambridge essay best.
      </p>

      <table class="compare">
        <tr>
          <th>Voice</th>
          <th>Characteristics</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Informal</strong></td>
          <td>Friendly, emotional, conversational.</td>
          <td><em>I think technology is great because it helps me every day!</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Neutral / Semi-formal</strong></td>
          <td>Calm, clear, suitable for general writing.</td>
          <td><em>Technology helps people manage daily life more efficiently.</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Formal</strong></td>
          <td>Objective, measured, used for academic writing.</td>
          <td><em>Technological innovation has significantly improved daily efficiency for many people.</em></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        For the C1 essay, your tone should sit between <strong>neutral and formal</strong> — natural, not robotic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Too informal sounds careless.<br>
        Too formal sounds artificial.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How to Sound Naturally Formal</h2>

      <p>
        Here are five practical ways to move from B2-level to C1-level formality without losing your voice.
      </p>

      <h3>(1) Avoid contractions</h3>

      <p>In formal exam writing, avoid forms like:</p>

      <p><strong>❌</strong> don’t, can’t, won’t, it’s<br>
        <strong>✅</strong> do not, cannot, will not, it is
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>❌</strong> It’s important that people don’t waste time online.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> It is important that people do not waste time online.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Small details like this instantly raise your level.</p>

      <h3>(2) Avoid slang and casual expressions</h3>

      <p>Replace vague or chatty words with more precise alternatives.</p>

      <p><strong>❌</strong> a lot of, kids, stuff, really good, gonna<br>
        <strong>✅</strong> many, children, materials, extremely beneficial, going to
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>❌</strong> A lot of kids spend too much time on their phones.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Many children spend excessive time on their mobile devices.</p>
      </div>

      <p>You are still saying the same thing — just with more maturity.</p>

      <h3>(3) Use precise, academic vocabulary</h3>

      <p>
        Avoid very general verbs and adjectives (think, good, bad, people, things, say, show) and aim for
        more specific choices.
      </p>

      <table class="compare">
        <tr>
          <th>Basic word</th>
          <th>More precise / academic options</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>think</td>
          <td>believe, consider, argue, maintain</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>good</td>
          <td>beneficial, useful, positive, advantageous</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>bad</td>
          <td>harmful, negative, problematic, detrimental</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>people</td>
          <td>individuals, citizens, consumers</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>things</td>
          <td>factors, issues, aspects, elements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>say</td>
          <td>state, suggest, claim, argue</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>show</td>
          <td>demonstrate, illustrate, reveal, indicate</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>❌</strong> It’s a good idea for people to travel.</p>
        <p><strong>✅</strong> Travelling can be highly beneficial, as it broadens individuals’ perspectives.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(4) Use cautious, balanced language</h3>

      <p>
        At C1, you avoid absolute claims like <em>“Technology is always bad.”</em><br>
        Instead, you use softeners that show awareness of complexity:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>it seems that…</li>
        <li>it appears that…</li>
        <li>to some extent…</li>
        <li>in certain cases…</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example (caution):</strong></p>
        <p>It appears that young people rely more on technology than older generations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Example (balance):</strong></p>
        <p>While this may be true, it does not apply to all situations.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This kind of phrasing sounds intelligent and realistic — perfect for a Cambridge essay.</p>

      <h3>(5) Avoid over-formality</h3>

      <p>Some students go too far and end up sounding unnatural:</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌ Over-formal:</strong></p>
        <p>In the modern epoch, multitudinous individuals are encumbered by occupational dilemmas.</p>

        <p><strong>✅ Balanced C1:</strong></p>
        <p>In today’s world, many people struggle with work-related stress.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over-formal writing feels heavy and artificial.<br>
        Keep your language simple, but elegant — that is the real sign of confidence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-grammar">
      <h2>4. Formal Grammar Constructions to Practise</h2>

      <p>
        Here are five grammar tools that add variety and professionalism to your essays — without sounding
        forced.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Passive voice (for formality and focus)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>It is widely believed that education improves equality.</li>
        <li>Governments are expected to invest in renewable energy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Use the passive to focus on actions or results, not on who does them.
        Do not overuse it — mix with active sentences for rhythm.
      </p>

      <h3>(b) Impersonal “it” structures</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>It is important to recognise that mental health affects productivity.</li>
        <li>It could be argued that freedom of choice is more valuable than stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These create a balanced, academic tone. They are especially useful in introductions and conclusions.</p>

      <h3>(c) Nominalisation (turning verbs into nouns)</h3>

      <p>
        Instead of: <em>People argue that schools should motivate students.</em><br>
        You can write: <em>There is an ongoing debate about student motivation in schools.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Nominalisation adds sophistication, but use it lightly — too many abstract nouns can make your
        writing heavy.
      </p>

      <h3>(d) Subordinate clauses for flexibility</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Although technology improves efficiency, it also reduces privacy.</li>
        <li>While some people prefer stability, others value change.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These structures show you can handle complex grammar confidently.</p>

      <h3>(e) Parallel structure (for emphasis)</h3>

      <p>Parallel patterns sound deliberate and polished:</p>

      <p><em>True progress depends on equality, on innovation, and on education.</em></p>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-balance-humanity">
      <h2>5. Balancing Formality and Humanity</h2>

      <p>
        Many students worry that writing formally means losing their natural voice.
        But the best formal writing still feels human — thoughtful, calm, and clear.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Too formal (cold):</strong></p>
        <p>It is incontrovertible that environmental degradation is an urgent phenomenon requiring immediate rectification.</p>

        <p><strong>Too informal (casual):</strong></p>
        <p>The environment is in big trouble, and we should do something fast.</p>

        <p><strong>Balanced (C1 tone):</strong></p>
        <p>Environmental damage is a serious issue that requires immediate and coordinated action.</p>
      </div>

      <p>That is the sweet spot — professional, yet warm and readable.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-modality">
      <h2>6. Using Modality for Softness and Precision</h2>

      <p>
        Modal verbs are excellent tools for sounding mature and polite.
        They help you express degrees of certainty instead of strong absolutes.
      </p>

      <table class="compare">
        <tr>
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Modals</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Suggestion</td>
          <td>could, might, may</td>
          <td>Governments could support local initiatives to reduce pollution.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Probability</td>
          <td>should, will probably</td>
          <td>This policy should improve access to education.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Caution</td>
          <td>might not, may not</td>
          <td>Online education may not suit every learner.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Necessity</td>
          <td>must, need to</td>
          <td>We must address climate change immediately.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Mixing modals lets you show nuance — the key to academic voice.</p>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u16-tone-paragraphs">
      <h2>7. Tone in Paragraphs: Confident but Calm</h2>

      <p>Let us see how tone can transform a paragraph.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>B2-level paragraph:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Many people use social media. It helps them talk to friends. But sometimes they spend too much
          time on it. This is not healthy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>C1-level rewrite (natural formality):</strong></p>
        <p>
          Social media allows people to stay connected and share information instantly. However, excessive
          use can lead to dependency and distraction. For this reason, users need to find a balance between
          online interaction and real-life communication.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Notice how:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the tone is calm and neutral,</li>
        <li>vocabulary is more precise,</li>
        <li>sentences are longer but not wordy,</li>
        <li>and transitions sound natural.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That is what natural formality looks like.</p>

      <h2>14. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        At C1 level, formality is not about hiding your voice.
        It is about refining it — shaping it into something polished, confident, and trustworthy.
      </p>

      <p>When you write with natural formality:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your ideas sound credible.</li>
        <li>Your tone feels balanced.</li>
        <li>Your message becomes persuasive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Formality is not distance — it is respect: for your reader, your subject, and your own writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before you finish your essay, read it once more and ask:<br>
        <strong>“Does this sound like something I would be proud to sign my name to?”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>If the answer is yes, your tone is exactly where it should be.</p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, we move to <strong>Unit 17: Editing for Style and Precision</strong>, where you will
        learn how to revise your writing at an advanced level — cutting repetition, tightening expression,
        and polishing your essay until every sentence feels deliberate and strong.
