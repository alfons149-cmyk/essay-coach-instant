 Unit 16: Style, Tone, and Natural Formality
 When you reach the C1 level, the question is no longer  
well do you sound?”
 “Can you write in English?”
 — it’s 
“How
 By now, you already know how to plan, structure, and link ideas. But what truly separates C1
 essays from B2 ones is  
style
 — how your writing  
feels
 to the reader.
 In this unit, we’ll explore what makes a text sound naturally formal and confidently written. You’ll
 learn how to achieve elegance without exaggeration, balance without stiffness, and warmth without
 informality.
 1. What Style and Tone Mean
 Let’s start with two key terms:
 Style
 Tone
 is how you use language — your sentence patterns, vocabulary, and structure.
 is the attitude your writing communicates — respectful, confident, curious, cautious, or
 balanced.
 In Cambridge essays, your goal is to achieve a  
tone
 .
 formal academic style
 This doesn’t mean you must sound cold or distant.
 The best essays sound measured, clear, and genuinely human.
 Remember:
 and a 
balanced, thoughtful
 Formality is not about sounding complicated — it’s about sounding careful.

 2. The Three Voices of Academic Writing
 At advanced level, we often talk about three main “voices” in English writing. Each one plays a
 role, but only one fits the Cambridge essay best.
 Informal
 Friendly, emotional, conversational.
 I think technology is great because it helps me every day!
 Neutral / Semi-formal
 Calm, clear, suitable for general writing.
 Technology helps people manage daily life more efficiently.
 Formal
 Objective, measured, used for academic writing.
 Technological innovation has significantly improved daily efficiency for many people.
 For the C1 essay
 , your tone should be between  
neutral and formal
 Too informal sounds careless. Too formal sounds artificial.
 3. How to Sound Naturally Formal
 — natural, not robotic.
 Let’s look at five practical ways to adjust your tone from B2-level to C1-level formality.

 (1) Avoid contractions
 ❌ 
✅ 
don’t, can’t, won’t, it’s
 do not, cannot, will not, it is
 Example:
 ❌ 
✅ 
It’s important that people don’t waste time online.
 It is important that people do not waste time online.
 Small details like this instantly raise your level.
 (2) Avoid slang and casual expressions
 ❌ 
✅ 
a lot of, kids, stuff, really good, gonna
 many, children, materials, extremely beneficial, going to
 Example:
 ❌ 
✅ 
A lot of kids spend too much time on their phones.
 Many children spend excessive time on their mobile devices.
 You’re still saying the same thing — just with more maturity.
 (3) Use precise, academic vocabulary
 Avoid words that feel vague or emotional.
 Choose ones that are factual and specific.

 Informal
 think - good - bad - people - things - say - show
 Neutral
 believe - useful - positive - negative - individuals - citizens - consumers - factors - issues - aspects 
state - suggest - claim - demonstrate - illustrate - reveal
 Formal
 consider / argue / maintain beneficial / advantageous  harmful / detrimental
 Example:
 ❌ 
✅ 
It’s a good idea for people to travel.
 Travelling can be highly beneficial, as it broadens individuals’ perspectives.
 Notice the shift — not just in words, but in tone.
 (4) Use cautious, balanced language
 At C1, you don’t make extreme statements like 
“Technology is always bad.”
 You use softeners to show awareness of complexity.

 Example
 Limiting
 to some extent, in certain cases
 To some extent, working from home increases productivity.
 Caution
 it seems that, it appears that
 It appears that young people rely more on technology than older generations.
 Balance
 while this may be true, nevertheless
 While this may be true, it does not apply to all situations.
 This kind of phrasing sounds intelligent and realistic — perfect for a Cambridge essay.
 (5) Avoid over-formality
 Some students go too far and sound unnatural.
 ❌ 
✅ 
In the modern epoch, multitudinous individuals are encumbered by occupational dilemmas.
 In today’s world, many people struggle with work-related stress.
 Over-formal writing feels heavy and artificial.
 Keep your language simple, but elegant.
 That’s the real sign of confidence.
 4. Formal Grammar Constructions to Practise
 Mastering Essay Writing for Cambridge Exams  - Course Book
 Page 189
The Cambridge Writing Coach
 Here are five grammar tools that add variety and professionalism to your essays — without
 sounding forced.
 (a) The Passive Voice (for formality and focus)
 It is widely believed that education improves equality.
 Governments are expected to invest in renewable energy.
 Use the passive to focus on actions or results, not on people.
 Just don’t overuse it — mix with active sentences for rhythm.
 (b) Impersonal “It” Structures
 It is important to recognise that mental health affects productivity.
 It could be argued that freedom of choice is more valuable than stability.
 These phrases create a balanced, academic tone.
 You can use them safely in introductions and conclusions.
 (c) Nominalisation (turning verbs into nouns)
 People argue that schools should motivate students.
 →
 There is an ongoing debate about student motivation in schools.
 Nominalisation adds sophistication, but use it lightly — too many can make your text sound
 abstract.
 (d) Subordinate Clauses for Flexibility
 Although technology improves efficiency, it also reduces privacy.
 While some people prefer stability, others value change.
 These structures show you can handle complex grammar confidently.

 (e) Parallel Structure (for emphasis)
 True progress depends on equality, on innovation, and on education.
 Balanced patterns like this make your writing sound polished and deliberate.
 5. Balancing Formality and Humanity
 Many students worry that writing formally means losing their natural voice.
 But the best formal writing still feels human — thoughtful, calm, and clear.
 Here’s a comparison:
 Too formal (cold):
 It is incontrovertible that environmental degradation is an urgent phenomenon requiring immediate
 rectification.
 Too informal (casual):
 The environment is in big trouble, and we should do something fast.
 Balanced (C1 tone):
 Environmental damage is a serious issue that requires immediate and coordinated action.
 That’s the sweet spot — professional, yet warm and readable.

 6. Using Modality for Softness and Precision
 Modal verbs are excellent tools for sounding mature and polite.
 They help you express degrees of certainty instead of strong absolutes.
 Example
 Suggestion
 could / might / may
 Governments could support local initiatives to reduce pollution.
 Probability
 should / will probably
 This policy should improve access to education.
 Caution
 might not / may not
 Online education may not suit every learner.
 Necessity
 must / need to
 We must address climate change immediately.
 Mixing modals lets you show nuance — the key to academic voice.

 7. Tone in Paragraphs: Confident but Calm
 Let’s see how tone transforms a paragraph.
 B2-level paragraph:
 Many people use social media. It helps them talk to friends. But sometimes they spend too much
 time on it. This is not healthy.
 C1-level rewrite (natural formality):
 Social media allows people to stay connected and share information instantly. However, excessive
 use can lead to dependency and distraction. For this reason, users need to find a balance between
 online interaction and real-life communication.
 Notice how:
 the tone is calm and neutral,
 vocabulary is precise,
 sentences are longer but not wordy,
 and transitions sound natural.
 That’s what natural formality looks like.
 8. Sounding Polite and Objective
 Cambridge essays should never sound aggressive or emotional.
 Even when you disagree, do so respectfully.

The Cambridge Writing Coach
 Impolite
 That idea is wrong.
 Everyone knows this.
 It is commonly believed that...
 I don’t agree.
 People must stop being lazy.
 Polite / Formal
 That view is not entirely convincing.
 I would argue that... / This view can be questioned.
 Individuals should take more personal responsibility.
 Your goal is to convince the reader through logic, not emotion.
 Politeness shows intellectual maturity.

 9. Stylistic Rhythm and Flow
 Advanced writing is not only what you say — it’s 
how it sounds
 Good rhythm keeps your writing readable and persuasive.
 Try this simple pattern when editing:
 1. Follow every long sentence with a shorter one.
 .
 2. Vary the opening of your sentences — don’t always start with “It” or “There.”
 3. Read your essay aloud softly; if it sounds heavy, simplify.
 Example:
 Many people believe that working from home improves efficiency because employees can manage
 their time more freely.  
However,
 remote work may also reduce team cooperation.  
mixed approach seems the most productive.
 Your ear is your best editor.
 10. Vocabulary for a Formal Tone
 Ultimately,
 Here’s a short collection of words that add natural formality without exaggeration.
 good
 beneficial, practical, valuable, advantageous

 12. Editing Your Essay for Tone
 After you finish writing, take one minute to check for tone.
 Ask yourself:
 Did I use contractions or informal words?
 Does my writing sound polite and objective?
 Are my sentences too long or too stiff?
 Would a teacher or examiner enjoy reading this?
 If the answer is yes, your tone is right.

 14. Final Reflection
 At C1 level, formality is not about hiding your voice.
 It’s about  
refining
 it — shaping it into something polished, confident, and trustworthy.

 When you write with natural formality:
 Your ideas sound credible.
 Your tone feels balanced.
 Your message becomes persuasive.
 Remember:
 Formality is not distance — it’s respect.
 You respect your reader, your subject, and your own writing.
 So before you finish your essay, read it once more and ask:
 “Does this sound like something I’d be proud to sign my name to?”
 If the answer is yes, your tone is exactly where it should be.
