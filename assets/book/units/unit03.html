    <h1>Types of Sentences and Connectors</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      By now, you know what clauses are and how basic word order works in English. You can build clear
      sentences with the subject, verb, and extra information in the right place. In this unit, we go one
      step further: you’ll learn how to <strong>combine ideas</strong> and <strong>connect them naturally</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      When you master sentence types and connectors, your writing stops sounding like a list of short
      statements and begins to feel like real communication. That is exactly what Cambridge examiners
      want to read.

    <!-- 1. Why Sentence Variety Matters -->
    <section id="u3-why-variety" class="unit-section">
      <h2>1. Why Sentence Variety Matters</h2>

      <p>Look at this short paragraph:</p>

      <p><em>
        I like my job. I work with friendly people. I learn something new every day. I sometimes get tired.
        I want to improve.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        Every sentence is correct, but the effect is flat. The rhythm never changes, so the reader quickly
        loses interest.
      </p>

      <p>Now try this version:</p>

      <p><em>
        I like my job because I work with great people, and I learn something new every day. Although I
        sometimes feel tired, I still want to improve.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        The ideas are the same, but the writing is more natural. Clauses are connected, and the sentence
        length varies. That is the power of <strong>sentence variety</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this unit we will explore four main sentence types and the connectors that help you create this
        natural flow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. The Four Types of Sentences -->
    <section id="u3-types" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. The Four Types of Sentences</h2>

      <p>
        There are only four basic sentence types, but together they give you everything you need for
        Cambridge exam writing.
      </p>

      <h3>a) Simple Sentence</h3>

      <p>
        A <strong>simple sentence</strong> has one independent clause. It may have more than one verb, but it
        expresses a single complete idea.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>I enjoy reading, speaking in public, and eating out.</li>
        <li>My teacher is kind and friendly.</li>
        <li>The meeting starts at ten.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Think of a simple sentence as a short breath. It is clear, direct, and confident. In essays, simple
        sentences are useful for emphasis or after longer structures to create rhythm:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Education shapes our society and determines its progress. Everyone deserves that chance.
      </em></p>

      <h3>b) Compound Sentence</h3>

      <p>
        A <strong>compound sentence</strong> joins two independent clauses (two complete sentences) with a
        connector. Both parts are equally important.
      </p>

      <p>There are three main ways to build them:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>With a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS)</strong><br>
          <em>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</em>
          <ul>
            <li>I studied hard, and I passed the exam.</li>
            <li>She wanted to go out, but it was raining.</li>
            <li>We didn’t have enough time, so we skipped dessert.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>With a semicolon (;)</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li>I worked very hard on my essay; it went really well.</li>
            <li>The bar is empty now; it’s usually crowded on weekends.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The semicolon creates a strong link and puts subtle emphasis on the second clause. Used well,
            this feels advanced and controlled.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>With a conjunctive adverb</strong> (we’ll explore these in detail soon)<br>
          <ul>
            <li>I wanted to go swimming; however, I was too tired.</li>
            <li>He didn’t study; therefore, he failed the exam.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Compound sentences are ideal when you want to show balance between two ideas, especially for
        contrast or cause and effect in essays.
      </p>

      <h3>c) Complex Sentence</h3>

      <p>
        A <strong>complex sentence</strong> contains one independent clause plus one or more dependent
        clauses (extra ideas that cannot stand alone).
      </p>

      <p>
        Dependent clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions such as
        <em>because, although, when, if, unless, while, since, before, after</em>.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Because it was late, we went home.</li>
        <li>Although I was tired, I finished my homework.</li>
        <li>I’ll call you when I arrive.</li>
        <li>We stayed inside while it was raining.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Complex sentences allow you to show logical relationships such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cause</strong> – because, since</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong> – although, even though</li>
        <li><strong>Time</strong> – when, while, after</li>
        <li><strong>Condition</strong> – if, unless</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are essential for clear, analytical writing in Cambridge exams.
      </p>

      <h3>d) Compound–Complex Sentence</h3>

      <p>
        A <strong>compound–complex sentence</strong> combines everything: it has at least two independent
        clauses and at least one dependent clause.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Because I had a headache, I went home, and I took an aspirin.</li>
        <li>Although it was raining, we decided to go out, and we had a great time.</li>
        <li>I love studying English because it’s useful, and it helps me express my ideas better.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These appear frequently at C1 and C2 level. They show you can manage several ideas in one
        sentence without losing clarity – a strong sign of advanced control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Understanding Connectors -->
    <section id="u3-connectors" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. Understanding Connectors</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you know the sentence types, you need the tools that link them:
        <strong>connectors</strong> (also called linking words).
      </p>

      <p>
        Connectors tell the reader how one idea relates to the next: reason, contrast, result, sequence,
        example, and so on. Without them, writing feels like separate pieces instead of one coherent
        message.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ll look at three main groups:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Coordinating conjunctions</li>
        <li>Conjunctive adverbs</li>
        <li>Subordinating conjunctions</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS) -->
    <section id="u3-coordinating" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)</h2>

      <p>
        You probably already know these: <strong>for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</strong>. They link two ideas of
        equal importance in a compound sentence.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Connector</th>
            <th>Function</th>
            <th>Example</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>for</td>
            <td>reason</td>
            <td>We stayed home, for it was raining.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>and</td>
            <td>addition</td>
            <td>He cooked dinner, and he washed the dishes.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>nor</td>
            <td>negative addition</td>
            <td>He didn’t call, nor did he send a message.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>but</td>
            <td>contrast</td>
            <td>I wanted to go out, but I was tired.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>or</td>
            <td>alternative</td>
            <td>You can take the bus, or you can walk.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>yet</td>
            <td>contrast (similar to “but”)</td>
            <td>The test was challenging, yet I passed.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>so</td>
            <td>result</td>
            <td>It started raining, so we stayed inside.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Notice the inversion after <em>nor</em> in the example: <em>nor did he send…</em> – this is typical and
        sounds very natural at B2–C2 levels.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Comma rule:</strong> use a comma before these words when they join two independent clauses:</p>

      <p>✅ <em>I studied all night, but I still didn’t pass.</em></p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Conjunctive Adverbs -->
    <section id="u3-conjunctive" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Conjunctive Adverbs</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Conjunctive adverbs</strong> are more formal linking words, ideal for essays and reports. They
        usually appear:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>after a semicolon <code>;</code> in the middle of a sentence, or</li>
        <li>at the beginning of a new sentence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In both cases, they are typically followed by a comma.</p>

      <p><strong>Common conjunctive adverbs</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding information:</strong> moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally</li>
        <li><strong>Showing contrast:</strong> however, nevertheless, on the other hand, in contrast</li>
        <li><strong>Showing result:</strong> therefore, thus, consequently, accordingly</li>
        <li><strong>Examples / emphasis:</strong> for example, indeed, in fact, certainly</li>
        <li><strong>Time / sequence:</strong> then, meanwhile, afterwards, subsequently</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Examples in context</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The course was challenging; <strong>however</strong>, I learned a lot.</li>
        <li>The project was successful; <strong>therefore</strong>, the manager congratulated the team.</li>
        <li>We studied hard; <strong>in fact</strong>, we reviewed every topic twice.</li>
        <li>He started working at nine; <strong>meanwhile</strong>, I was still sleeping.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These connectors sound academic and elegant. They help you avoid repeating “and” or “but” and
        give your writing a more professional tone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Subordinating Conjunctions -->
    <section id="u3-subordinating" class="unit-section">
      <h2>6. Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Subordinating conjunctions</strong> introduce dependent clauses and show a clear relationship
        between ideas.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Common groups</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cause / Reason:</strong> because, since, as<br>
          <em>I stayed at home because I was sick.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contrast / Concession:</strong> although, even though, whereas, while<br>
          <em>Although it was cold, we went for a walk.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time:</strong> when, while, after, before, until, since<br>
          <em>We left after we finished dinner.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condition:</strong> if, unless, provided that, as long as<br>
          <em>You can go out if you finish your homework.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose / Result:</strong> so that, in order that<br>
          <em>She spoke clearly so that everyone could understand.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These words are essential for expressing logic, which is exactly what examiners look for in your
        essays.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Example in an essay</strong></p>

      <p><em>
        Although online learning is convenient, it can never replace real human interaction because students
        need face-to-face communication to develop social skills.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        Here, <em>although</em> introduces contrast and <em>because</em> introduces reason – two layers of logic
        in one sentence.

    <!-- 7. Common Mistakes with Connectors -->
    <section id="u3-mistakes" class="unit-section">
      <h2>7. Common Mistakes with Connectors</h2>

      <p>Let’s correct some typical learner problems.</p>

      <p>❌ <em>Because I was tired. I went home.</em><br>
         ✅ <em>Because I was tired, I went home.</em></p>

      <p>
        The dependent clause <em>Because I was tired</em> cannot stand alone. It must be connected to a main
        clause.
      </p>

      <p>❌ <em>I studied hard, however I failed the test.</em><br>
         ✅ <em>I studied hard; however, I failed the test.</em></p>

      <p>
        A conjunctive adverb like <em>however</em> needs a stronger break (semicolon or full stop) before it.
      </p>

      <p>❌ <em>Although it was raining but we went out.</em><br>
         ✅ <em>Although it was raining, we went out.</em></p>

      <p>
        Never use <em>although</em> and <em>but</em> together. Choose one connector, not both.

      <p><em>
        Although learning English writing takes time, it can be an enjoyable process if you understand how
        sentences work. First, you need to master the structure of clauses and phrases. Then, you can
        connect your ideas using conjunctions and linking words. As a result, your essays will not only
        sound more natural but will also show examiners that you control the language. Writing well is not
        about long words — it is about clear, connected sentences that express ideas logically.
      </em></p>

      <p>
        In that short paragraph, you can see:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>complex and compound–complex sentences</li>
        <li>a range of connectors (<em>although, if, then, as a result</em>)</li>
        <li>a natural rhythm and clear progression of ideas</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That is exactly the effect Cambridge examiners look for. In the next unit, we will build on this
        foundation by exploring punctuation and sentence flow — how commas, semicolons, and full stops
        bring even more control and elegance to your writing.
