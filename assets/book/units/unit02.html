    <h1>Word Order and Sentence Structure</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In English, word order is not very flexible. You cannot move words around as freely as you might in other
      languages. Even if all the words are correct, the sentence can still sound wrong if the word order is strange.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will look at the basic English sentence pattern and the most important positions for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the subject and the verb</li>
      <li>objects</li>
      <li>adverbs of frequency</li>
      <li>time, place, and manner information</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Once you control these patterns, your sentences will sound more natural, clear, and confident – exactly what
      Cambridge examiners are looking for.

      <h2>1. The Basic English Sentence Pattern</h2>
      <p>For most statements in English, the “neutral” word order is:</p>

      <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra information)</p>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I wrote my essay yesterday.</li>
        <li>She bought a new laptop last week.</li>
        <li>They watched a film at home.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can add extra information after the object. This extra information usually answers the questions: how,
        where, when, and why.
      </p>

      <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + Manner + Place + Time + Purpose</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        I wrote my essay carefully in my room last night because I wanted to improve my writing.
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> I</li>
        <li><strong>Verb:</strong> wrote</li>
        <li><strong>Object:</strong> my essay</li>
        <li><strong>Manner:</strong> carefully (how?)</li>
        <li><strong>Place:</strong> in my room (where?)</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> last night (when?)</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> because I wanted to improve my writing (why?)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need to include all these parts every time, but the order is important. English likes stable
        patterns. If you put the parts in a strange order, the sentence feels uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>She studied English hard at home last weekend to prepare for the exam.</li>
        <li>They discussed the problem calmly in the office yesterday afternoon.</li>
        <li>We met our friends in the park on Saturday to celebrate his birthday.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 2. Adverbs of frequency -->
    <section id="adverbs-frequency" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. Adverbs of Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        Adverbs of frequency (such as <em>always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never</em>) have a very specific
        place in English sentences. This is a common problem for learners.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>2.1 With normal (lexical) verbs</h3>
        <p>
          When the verb is a normal action verb (e.g. <em>go, eat, study, watch</em>), the adverb of frequency
          usually goes before the main verb:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">Subject + adverb of frequency + main verb …</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I often eat lunch at school.</li>
          <li>She usually goes to bed late.</li>
          <li>We sometimes watch films in English.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ❌ <em>I eat often lunch at school.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>I often eat lunch at school.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>2.2 With the verb <em>to be</em></h3>
        <p>
          When the main verb is <em>be</em> (am / is / are / was / were), the adverb of frequency comes
          <strong>after</strong> the verb:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">Subject + be + adverb of frequency …</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>He is always late.</li>
          <li>They are usually very helpful.</li>
          <li>My teacher is sometimes strict.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ❌ <em>He always is late.</em><br>
          ✅ <em>He is always late.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>2.3 With auxiliary verbs</h3>
        <p>
          When there is an auxiliary verb (e.g. <em>have, will, can, must</em>), the adverb of frequency usually comes
          after the auxiliary and before the main verb.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>She has never been to London.</li>
          <li>We will always remember this trip.</li>
          <li>They can usually finish the homework in 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="formula">
          Subject + auxiliary + adverb of frequency + main verb …

    <section id="time-place-manner" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. Time, Place, and Manner</h2>
      <p>
        When you add information about where, when, and how, English follows a typical order, especially in more
        neutral sentences.
      </p>

      <p class="formula">Manner → Place → Time</p>
      <p>Think: <strong>How? Where? When?</strong> – in that order – after the object of the verb.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">She answered the question calmly in class yesterday.</p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Manner:</strong> calmly</li>
        <li><strong>Place:</strong> in class</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> yesterday</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>He parked his car carefully in front of the school this morning.</li>
        <li>They played football enthusiastically in the park last Sunday.</li>
        <li>I finished my essay quickly at my desk last night.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can move the time phrase to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis, but the rest should usually stay
        in the same order.
      </p>

      <ul class="example-list">
        <li>✅ <strong>Yesterday,</strong> I finished my essay quickly at my desk.</li>
        <li>❌ I finished quickly my essay at my desk yesterday.</li>

      <h2>4. Common Word Order Mistakes</h2>
      <p>Here are some typical mistakes made by learners and how to correct them.</p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.1 Putting adverbs in the wrong place</h3>
        <p>❌ I eat often in restaurants.</p>
        <p>✅ I often eat in restaurants.</p>
        <p>❌ We go usually by car to school.</p>
        <p>✅ We usually go to school by car.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.2 Splitting the verb and object</h3>
        <p>
          In English, we normally keep the verb and its object together. Don’t separate them with too much
          information.
        </p>
        <p>❌ She wrote carefully her essay yesterday.</p>
        <p>✅ She wrote her essay carefully yesterday.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.3 Wrong position of time phrases</h3>
        <p>
          Time phrases can go at the beginning or the end, but they usually do not sit in the middle of the sentence
          between the subject and verb.
        </p>
        <p>❌ I tomorrow will go to the cinema.</p>
        <p>✅ Tomorrow, I will probably go to the cinema.</p>
        <p>✅ I will probably go to the cinema tomorrow.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>4.4 Word order in questions</h3>
        <p>In questions, English almost always uses <strong>auxiliary + subject + verb</strong> (except with <em>be</em>).</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where do you live?</li>
          <li>What time does the exam start?</li>
          <li>Why did she leave so early?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>❌ Where you live?</p>
        <p>✅ Where do you live?</p>
        <p>
          We will work more systematically on question forms later, but it is good to keep this pattern in mind
          already.

    <section id="comparing-languages" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Comparing with Other Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Many learners naturally translate from their own language into English. In Spanish, Dutch, and other
        languages, you can often move words around more freely without losing correctness.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>In some languages, you can place the time at the beginning, middle, or end without much change.</li>
        <li>You may put adverbs in positions that feel natural in your language but sound strange in English.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key is to remember that English values a stable word order. When in doubt, return to:
      </p>

      <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + (Manner) + (Place) + (Time)</p>

      <p>
        Once this pattern becomes automatic, you can play more with word order for emphasis, but first you need a
        solid “default” structure.

      <p>
        Word order is one of the small details that make a big difference in Cambridge writing. Even if your
        vocabulary and ideas are good, strange word order can make your writing sound less natural and less advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this unit, you have seen how English typically organises information in a sentence and where the most
        common adverbs and time/place phrases go. In the next units, we will build on this foundation and look at how
        to connect sentences into clear, logical paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: clear word order helps the examiner follow your ideas quickly and easily – and that helps your mark.
