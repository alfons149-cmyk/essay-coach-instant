    <h1>Understanding the B2 Essay Task</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      So far, you have learned how to build strong sentences, logical paragraphs, and smooth connections.
      Now it is time to put everything together in a full Cambridge-style essay.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Writing the B2 essay is not just about answering a question. It is about showing that you can organise
      your ideas clearly, express your opinion politely, and use English accurately and naturally under time
      pressure.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      This unit will help you understand precisely <strong>what</strong> the B2 essay task is,
      <strong>why</strong> it exists, and <strong>how</strong> examiners reward structure and logic
      even more than “fancy” vocabulary.

    <!-- 1. What the B2 essay is -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-what-essay">
      <h2>1. What the B2 Essay Is</h2>

      <p>
        In the <strong>Cambridge B2 First (FCE)</strong> exam, Part 1 of the Writing paper is always an
        <strong>essay</strong>. You do not choose the task – everyone must write the same essay.
      </p>

      <p>Here is what a typical exam task looks like:</p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example task</h3>
        <p><em>
          In your English class you have been talking about the environment. Now your teacher has asked you
          to write an essay.
        </em></p>
        <p><em>
          Write an essay using all the notes and giving reasons for your point of view.
        </em></p>

        <p><strong>Some people say that the best way to protect the environment is to use public transport.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. cost</li>
          <li>2. convenience</li>
          <li>3. your own idea</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>You must write between 140 and 190 words.</em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        If you write fewer than <strong>140 words</strong>, you risk losing marks because your ideas may not be
        developed enough. If you write more than <strong>190 words</strong>, the examiner may stop reading after
        around 200 words. Focus on <strong>clarity</strong>, not quantity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. What the task really tests -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-what-tests">
      <h2>2. What the Task Really Tests</h2>

      <p>
        The essay is not testing your <em>opinion</em> on the topic. It is testing how clearly and effectively
        you can express ideas in formal English.
      </p>

      <p>
        The B2 essay is marked using four categories from the official
        <strong>Cambridge Assessment Scale</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Content:</strong> Have you answered the question completely?
          Did you cover all the notes and include your own idea?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communicative Achievement:</strong> Is the tone appropriate?
          Does it sound like formal writing (no slang, no contractions, polite and logical tone)?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organisation:</strong> Are ideas logically connected and easy to follow?
          Do you have clear paragraphs, linking words, and a balanced structure?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Language:</strong> Is your grammar and vocabulary accurate and varied?
          Do you show a good range of tenses, collocations, linking words, and clear punctuation?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To score well, your essay must satisfy <strong>all four</strong> areas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. What the examiner wants -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-examiner-wants">
      <h2>3. What the Examiner Wants to See</h2>

      <p>
        Examiners do not expect perfection. They look for evidence that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>you understand the task,</li>
        <li>you can organise your ideas logically,</li>
        <li>you can communicate clearly in a formal style.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They are asking themselves:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is this essay easy to follow?</li>
        <li>Does the writer use enough variety in grammar and vocabulary?</li>
        <li>Does it feel like something a real B2 student would write?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That is why structure and flow – the things you have practised in earlier units – are so powerful.
        They immediately tell the examiner: <em>“This writer knows how to organise ideas.”</em>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Typical essay structure -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-structure">
      <h2>4. The Typical Essay Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The best way to approach a B2 essay is with a clear four-part structure:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Introduction</strong> – present the topic and your opinion clearly
          (about 2–3 sentences).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Body paragraph 1</strong> – discuss one of the given points (e.g. <em>cost</em>)
          (about 4–5 sentences).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Body paragraph 2</strong> – discuss the second point (e.g. <em>convenience</em>)
          and your own idea (about 4–5 sentences).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conclusion</strong> – summarise and give your final opinion
          (about 2–3 sentences).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This format is not completely fixed, but it helps you keep control, show balance, and avoid repetition –
        all things examiners value highly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Writing the introduction -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-introduction">
      <h2 id="u9-introduction">5. Writing the Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Your introduction has three main jobs:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Introduce the topic in a general way.</li>
        <li>Mention both sides or perspectives (e.g. advantages and disadvantages).</li>
        <li>End with your opinion or main idea.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Example (environment topic):</strong></p>

      <p class="example">
        Many people believe that using public transport is the best way to protect the environment, while others
        prefer using private cars for comfort and flexibility. Personally, I think that public transport plays a
        very important role, but it is not the only solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice how the tone is formal but not stiff. We use polite, clear expressions such as
        <em>many people believe</em>, <em>personally, I think</em>, and <em>plays an important role</em>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Developing the body paragraphs -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-body-paragraphs">
      <h2>6. Developing the Body Paragraphs</h2>

      <p>
        Each body paragraph should focus on <strong>one main idea</strong>, usually taken from the notes in the task.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the <strong>PEEL</strong> method you learned earlier:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>P – Point:</strong> state your argument (one clear idea)</li>
        <li><strong>E – Evidence/example:</strong> support it with a short example or reason</li>
        <li><strong>E – Explain:</strong> develop your idea; show why it matters</li>
        <li><strong>L – Link:</strong> connect back to the topic or forward to the next paragraph</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example (Paragraph 1: “cost”)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Firstly, public transport is often cheaper than driving a private car. For example, a monthly bus pass
          usually costs much less than the fuel and parking expenses for a car. This makes it easier for people to
          travel without worrying about money, which can encourage more people to use it rather than drive.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example (Paragraph 2: “convenience + your own idea”)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          However, some people prefer driving because it is faster and more comfortable, especially in areas where
          buses or trains are not frequent. Therefore, improving the quality and reliability of public transport
          could make it a more attractive option for everyone. In my opinion, governments should invest not only in
          public transport but also in bike lanes and green spaces to reduce pollution more broadly.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        These two paragraphs cover all the notes (cost, convenience, and your own idea) while keeping the argument
        clear and logical.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Writing the conclusion -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-conclusion">
      <h2 id="u9-conclusion">7. Writing the Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Your conclusion should not add new information. Its job is to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>summarise what you have already said, and</li>
        <li>give a clear final opinion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

      <p class="example">
        In conclusion, using public transport is an effective way to protect the environment, but it works best
        when combined with other actions such as cycling and reducing waste. Everyone has a role to play in creating
        a cleaner planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simple, polite, balanced – this is the typical Cambridge tone for a B2 essay conclusion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Style and register -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u9-style-register">
      <h2>8. Style and Register: The Formal Voice</h2>

      <p>
        The B2 essay should sound <strong>semi-formal to formal</strong>. That means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid contractions:</strong><br>
          ❌ don’t, can’t, it’s<br>
          ✅ do not, cannot, it is
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid slang or very informal words:</strong><br>
          ❌ a bunch of people, kids, cool<br>
          ✅ many people, children, beneficial
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid direct questions to the reader:</strong><br>
          ❌ Do you agree?<br>
          ✅ It could be argued that…
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid strong emotional language:</strong><br>
          ❌ I hate pollution!<br>
          ✅ Pollution remains a serious problem in modern cities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead, use polite, academic-sounding phrases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>It is widely believed that…</li>
        <li>One clear advantage is that…</li>
        <li>On the other hand…</li>
        <li>It seems clear that…</li>
        <li>In my view… / From my perspective…</li>
        <li>For this reason… / As a result… / Consequently…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You do not need to sound like a professor – just like a confident, educated writer.

      <h2>9. Managing the Word Count</h2>

      <p>
        Your essay must be <strong>140–190 words</strong> – no more, no less. That is about 12–14 lines of
        handwriting.
      </p>

      <p>The key is balance: do not waste words in the introduction, and do not try to include too many ideas.</p>

        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>2–3 minutes:</strong> Read the question carefully. Underline the notes.</li>

          On the one hand, more demanding exams might motivate students to study harder and take school more seriously.

      <h2>14. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Writing the B2 essay is not about producing a masterpiece. It is about showing control,
        organisation, and calm logic under pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        When your essay has:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>a clear structure,</li>
        <li>a formal tone,</li>
        <li>smooth flow, and</li>
        <li>one clear message per paragraph,</li>

      <p>
        you are already well above average. Do not rush, and do not panic. If you write like a teacher – calm,

    Unit 9 focuses on how to give your ideas <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>support</strong> through 
    clear examples and logical development — one of the most important skills for B2 and C1 essays.

    As a result, their learning becomes less efficient, and they remember less information. <em>(Result)</em>

  <h3>2) What Makes a Good Example?</h3>

  <p>Cambridge examiners look for examples that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Realistic</strong> — believable school, work, or everyday situations</li>
    <li><strong>Relevant</strong> — clearly connected to the point</li>
    <li><strong>Short</strong> — 1–2 sentences maximum</li>
    <li><strong>Specific</strong> — not vague (“people”, “things”, “a lot of reasons”)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Weak example:</strong> “People use the internet a lot.”</p>
  <p><strong>Stronger example:</strong> “For instance, many students now submit homework through online platforms such as Google Classroom.”</p>

  <h3>3) Useful Phrases for Introducing Examples</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>For example, …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>For instance, …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>A clear example of this is …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>This can be seen when …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>One illustration of this is …</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Advanced C1 connectors:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In particular, …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>This is especially true when …</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Studies show that …</strong> (for general statements)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4) Common Development Problems (and how to fix them)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Example is too general → <em>Make it concrete.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Example is unrelated → <em>Check the link with your topic sentence.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Paragraph jumps from idea to idea → <em>Use the structure Point → Explain → Example → Result.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Too many examples → <em>Use one strong one, not three weak ones.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) Mini Practice</h3>

  <p><strong>Improve this weak development:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Some people prefer online shopping. It is convenient. You can shop anytime.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Improved version:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Some people prefer online shopping because it is far more convenient than going to a physical store.
    <br>For example, customers can compare prices or buy products late at night without waiting in long queues.
    <br>As a result, many people now save both time and money by purchasing items online.
  </p>

    <li>✔ Every paragraph has one clear point</li>
    <li>✔ You explain <em>why</em> the point matters</li>
    <li>✔ You give a short, specific example</li>
    <li>✔ You show the result or consequence</li>
