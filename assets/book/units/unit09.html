<h2>Unit 9: Understanding the B2 Essay Task</h2>

<p>
  So far, you’ve learned how to build strong sentences, logical paragraphs, and smooth connections.
  Now it’s time to put everything together in a full Cambridge-style essay.
</p>

<p>
  Writing the B2 essay is not just about answering a question. It’s about showing that you can
  organise your ideas clearly, express your opinion politely, and use English accurately and
  naturally under time pressure.
</p>

<p>
  This unit will help you understand precisely <strong>what</strong> the B2 essay task is, <strong>how</strong> to approach it,
  and <strong>why</strong> examiners reward structure and logic even more than “fancy” words.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. What the B2 Essay Is</h3>

<p>
  In the exam, Part 1 of the Writing paper is always an <strong>essay</strong>.  
  You don’t choose the task — <strong>everyone</strong> must write the essay.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s what a typical task looks like:
</p>

<p><em>
  In your English class you have been talking about the environment.  
  Now your teacher has asked you to write an essay.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>cost</li>
  <li>convenience</li>
  <li>your own idea</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You must write between <strong>140 and 190 words</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you write fewer than 140, you risk losing marks because your ideas may not be developed enough.</li>
  <li>If you write more than 190, the examiner may stop reading after about 200 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  So the key is balance: enough development, but no unnecessary repetition.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. What the Task Really Tests</h3>

<p>
  The essay is not testing your personal opinion on the topic.  
  It’s testing how clearly and effectively you can express ideas in <strong>formal English</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The B2 essay measures four areas – the same ones on the official
  <strong>Cambridge Writing Assessment Scale</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Content</strong><br>
    Have you answered the question entirely?  
    Did you cover all the notes and include your own idea?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Communicative Achievement</strong><br>
    Is the tone appropriate? Does it sound like formal writing?  
    (No slang, no contractions, polite and logical tone.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Organisation</strong><br>
    Are ideas logically connected and easy to follow?  
    (Clear paragraphs, linking words, balanced structure.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Language</strong><br>
    Is your grammar and vocabulary accurate and varied?  
    (Range of tenses, collocations, linking words, correct punctuation.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To score well, your essay must satisfy all four.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. What the Examiner Wants to See</h3>

<p>
  When examiners mark your essay, they don’t expect perfection.  
  They look for evidence that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>you understand the task,</li>
  <li>you can organise your ideas logically,</li>
  <li>you can communicate clearly in a formal style.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  They’re asking themselves:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this essay easy to follow?</li>
  <li>Does the writer use enough variety in grammar and vocabulary?</li>
  <li>Does it feel like something a student at the B2 level would genuinely write?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  That’s why structure and flow — the things you’ve practised in earlier units — are so powerful.
  They instantly tell the examiner: <em>“This writer knows how to organise ideas.”</em>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. The Typical Essay Structure</h3>

<p>
  The best way to approach a B2 essay is with a clear four-part structure:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>  
    Present the topic and your opinion clearly.  
    <em>Length:</em> 2–3 sentences
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Body Paragraph 1</strong>  
    Discuss one of the given points (e.g. cost).  
    <em>Length:</em> 4–5 sentences
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Body Paragraph 2</strong>  
    Discuss the second point (e.g. convenience) <em>and</em> your own idea.  
    <em>Length:</em> 4–5 sentences
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>  
    Summarise and give your final opinion.  
    <em>Length:</em> 2–3 sentences
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This format isn’t the only possible one, but it helps you keep control.  
  It shows balance and prevents repetition — two things examiners value highly.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Writing the Introduction</h3>

<p>Your introduction should do three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Introduce</strong> the topic generally.</li>
  <li><strong>Mention</strong> both sides (advantages/disadvantages, pros/cons, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>End</strong> with your opinion (or main idea).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example (for our environment topic)</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Many people believe that using public transport is the best way to protect the environment, while
  others prefer using private cars for comfort and flexibility. Personally, I think that public
  transport plays a very important role, but it is not the only solution.
</em></p>

<p>
  Notice how the tone is formal, not emotional.  
  We use expressions such as <em>many people believe</em>, <em>personally, I think</em> and 
  <em>plays an important role</em> — polite, clear, and appropriate for B2.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Developing the Body Paragraphs</h3>

<p>
  Each body paragraph should focus on <strong>one main idea</strong> from the notes.
</p>

<p>
  Use the <strong>PEEL</strong> method you saw before:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>P – Point:</strong> state your argument</li>
  <li><strong>E – Evidence/example:</strong> give support</li>
  <li><strong>E – Explain:</strong> develop the idea</li>
  <li><strong>L – Link:</strong> connect to the next paragraph or to the main question</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example (Paragraph 1: “cost”)</h4>

<p><em>
  Firstly, public transport is often cheaper than driving a private car. For example, a monthly bus
  pass usually costs much less than the fuel and parking expenses for a car. This makes it easier
  for people to travel without worrying about money, which can encourage more people to use it
  rather than drive.
</em></p>

<h4>Example (Paragraph 2: “convenience + your own idea”)</h4>

<p><em>
  However, some people prefer driving because it is faster and more comfortable, especially in
  areas where buses or trains are not frequent. Therefore, improving the quality and reliability of
  public transport could make it a more attractive option for everyone. In my opinion, governments
  should invest not only in public transport but also in bike lanes and green spaces to reduce
  pollution more broadly.
</em></p>

<p>
  These two paragraphs cover all the notes (cost, convenience, and your own idea) while keeping the
  argument clear and logical.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Writing the Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  Your conclusion should not add new information — it should summarise what you’ve already said
  and give a final opinion.
</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p><em>
  In conclusion, using public transport is an effective way to protect the environment, but it
  works best when combined with other actions such as cycling and reducing waste. Everyone has a
  role to play in creating a cleaner planet.
</em></p>

<p>
  Simple, polite, balanced — that’s the Cambridge tone.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Style and Register: The Formal Voice</h3>

<p>
  The B2 essay should sound <strong>semi-formal to formal</strong>. That means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid contractions</strong><br>
    ❌ don’t, can’t, it’s  
    ✅ do not, cannot, it is
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid slang or very informal words</strong><br>
    ❌ a bunch of people, kids, cool  
    ✅ many people, children, beneficial
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid direct questions to the reader</strong><br>
    ❌ Do you agree?  
    ✅ It could be argued that…
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid strong emotional language</strong><br>
    ❌ I hate pollution!  
    ✅ Pollution remains a serious problem in modern cities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, use polite, academic-sounding phrases such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is widely believed that…</li>
  <li>One clear advantage is that…</li>
  <li>On the other hand…</li>
  <li>It seems clear that…</li>
  <li>In my view… / From my perspective…</li>
  <li>For this reason… / As a result… / Consequently…</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You’re not trying to sound like a professor — just like a confident, educated writer.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Managing the Word Count</h3>

<p>
  Your essay must be <strong>140–190 words</strong> — no more, no less.  
  That’s about 12–14 lines of writing.
</p>

<p>
  The key is balance: don’t waste words in your introduction, and don’t try to include too many
  ideas. Here’s a good word distribution:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> 25–35 words</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> 45–55 words</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> 45–55 words</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 20–30 words</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It’s far better to write a short, complete essay than a long, unfinished one.  
  The examiner is looking for clarity, not quantity.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>10. Time Management in the Exam</h3>

<p>
  You have about <strong>40 minutes</strong> for the essay.
</p>

<p><strong>A simple time plan:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>2–3 minutes: Read the question carefully. Underline the notes.</li>
  <li>5–7 minutes: Plan your ideas and structure.</li>
  <li>25 minutes: Write your essay calmly.</li>
  <li>5 minutes: Read it again and correct mistakes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Planning may feel slow, but it saves time later.  
  A clear plan helps you write faster and with fewer errors.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>11. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> Ignoring one of the notes  
    <strong>Example:</strong> only writing about “cost” and “convenience”  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Always include your <em>own idea</em> — it’s required.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> Writing too informally  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Use a consistent formal/semi-formal tone:  
    <em>People should make an effort to recycle.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> No clear opinion  
    <strong>Example:</strong> Only describing both sides without a conclusion  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> End clearly: <em>In my view, recycling is essential.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> Word count too short  
    <strong>Example:</strong> 120 words  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Add one more example or short explanation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> Word count too long  
    <strong>Example:</strong> 210 words  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Combine sentences or remove repetition.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mistake:</strong> Mixing styles  
    <strong>Example:</strong> <em>Kids these days… It is widely believed…</em>  
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Stay consistent: choose a formal register throughout.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>12. Example of a Full B2 Essay (Model Answer)</h3>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Some people say that the best way to improve education is to make exams more difficult.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> fairness – motivation – your own idea</p>

<p><strong>Essay (≈180 words):</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Exams are a common way to measure students’ progress, but many people debate their fairness and
  usefulness. Some believe that making exams more difficult could improve education, while others
  think this would only create stress.
</em></p>

<p><em>
  On the one hand, more demanding exams might motivate students to study harder and take school
  more seriously. They could also help teachers identify which students really understand the
  material. However, this approach can be unfair to learners who are nervous or who perform better
  in practical activities rather than written tests.
</em></p>

<p><em>
  On the other hand, improving education is not only about exams. It is also about the quality of
  teaching and the availability of support for students who struggle. For example, smaller class
  sizes and more interactive lessons could make learning more effective for everyone.
</em></p>

<p><em>
  In conclusion, while exams are necessary to test knowledge, they should not be the only focus. A
  balanced system that values understanding and participation would lead to a better education for
  all.
</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>13. What Makes This Essay Successful</h3>

<ul>
  <li>✅ All three notes are covered (fairness, motivation, own idea).</li>
  <li>✅ Clear structure (introduction – two body paragraphs – conclusion).</li>
  <li>✅ Logical connectors (<em>on the one hand, on the other hand, while, however, for example</em>).</li>
  <li>✅ Formal tone, no slang.</li>
  <li>✅ Balanced argument and clear final opinion.</li>
  <li>✅ Within the word limit.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is the type of essay that typically earns Band 3–4 marks in the B2 Writing Paper.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>14. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
  Writing the B2 essay is not about producing a masterpiece — it’s about showing control,
  organisation, and calm logic under pressure.
</p>

<p>
  When your essay has:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a clear structure,</li>
  <li>a formal tone,</li>
  <li>smooth flow, and</li>
  <li>one clear message per paragraph,</li>
</ul>

<p>
  you are already well above average.
</p>

<p>
  Don’t rush. Don’t panic.  
  If you write like a teacher — calm, balanced, clear — your examiner will trust you.
</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong>  
  Write less, but write better.  
  At B2 level, success comes from structure, not speed.
