      Stop letting AI write for you.<br>
      <span>Learn to write Cambridge essays yourself.</span>
    </h1>

    <p class="landing-intro-text">
      These days, it’s easy to ask AI to write an essay for you. But in the exam,
      <strong>AI isn’t sitting next to you</strong>. You are on your own — your ideas,
      your language, your timing.
    </p>

    <p class="landing-intro-text">
      This app acts as your <strong>personal teacher</strong>: it checks your essays in under a minute,
      highlights your mistakes the way a Cambridge examiner would, and gives you a complete
      course book with all the rules you need from <strong>B2 to C2</strong>.

          <h3>1. The exam is offline</h3>
          <p>
            In the exam room, you cannot ask AI to “fix” your writing. You need to know
            how to structure your ideas, choose the right words, and avoid typical mistakes
            <strong>by yourself</strong>.

          <h3>2. Real progress takes practice</h3>
          <p>
            You don’t learn to write Cambridge-level essays in a few days. It takes
            repeated practice, clear explanations, and targeted correction of
            <strong>your personal mistakes</strong>.

          <p>
            Cambridge rewards specific skills: task achievement, organisation, range of language,
            and accuracy. This app and book show you exactly <strong>how they want you to write</strong>.
