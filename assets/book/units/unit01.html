    <h1>Clauses, Phrases, and Sentences</h1>
    <p class="unit-intro">
      Before we can write clear, elegant essays, we must first understand what English writing is built on –
      <strong>the sentence</strong>. Every sentence has a structure, and that structure depends on
      <strong>clauses</strong> and <strong>phrases</strong>. Think of them as building blocks of meaning.
      Once you know how to use these blocks, you can build anything – from a short, simple sentence to a long,
      beautifully connected paragraph.

      <h2>1. What Is a Clause?</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a <strong>subject</strong> and a
        <strong>verb</strong>. That’s the key:
      </p>

      <p class="formula"><strong>subject + verb = clause</strong></p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
        <li>She is reading a book.</li>
        <li>We went to the beach.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are complete thoughts because they tell us <em>who</em> is doing something and <em>what</em>
        they are doing. These are called <strong>independent clauses</strong> — they can stand alone.
      </p>

      <p>Now compare these:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Because I studied hard</li>
        <li>When it stopped raining</li>
        <li>Although I wasn’t hungry</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These also contain a subject and a verb, but they do not express a complete idea. They are
        <strong>dependent clauses</strong> — they depend on another clause to make sense.
      </p>

    <!-- 2. What is a phrase? -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-phrase">
      <h2>2. What Is a Phrase?</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of words that works as a single unit of meaning but does
        <strong>not</strong> contain both a subject and a verb.
      </p>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>in the morning</li>
        <li>with a big smile</li>
        <li>to find a solution</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Phrases add detail and meaning to your writing, but they cannot form sentences on their own.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. What is a complete sentence? -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-complete-sentence">
      <h2>3. What Is a Complete Sentence?</h2>

      <p>
        A complete sentence must contain:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>at least one independent clause</li>
        <li>a complete idea</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples of complete sentences:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>She cooked dinner after she finished her homework.</li>
        <li>Although it was late, we decided to keep walking.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This unit is your foundation. All later units — paragraph structure, cohesion, advanced grammar —
        depend on your ability to build clear, controlled sentences.

      <h2>4. Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        If you can recognise clauses, phrases, and complete sentences, you can already see the “bones” of English.
        In the next units, you’ll learn how to arrange these bones into strong, flexible paragraphs and, finally,
        into full Cambridge exam essays.
