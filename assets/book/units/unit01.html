    <h1>Word Order and Sentence Structure</h1>
    <p class="unit-intro">
      In English, word order is not very flexible. You cannot move words around as freely as you might in other
      languages. Even if all the words are correct, the sentence can still sound wrong if the word order is strange.
    </p>
    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will look at the basic English sentence pattern and the most important positions for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the subject and the verb</li>
      <li>objects</li>
      <li>adverbs of frequency</li>
      <li>time, place, and manner information</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="unit-intro">
      Once you control these patterns, your sentences will sound more natural, clear, and confident – exactly what
      Cambridge examiners are looking for.

      <h2>1. The Basic English Sentence Pattern</h2>
      <p>For most statements in English, the “neutral” word order is:</p>
      <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra information)</p>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I wrote my essay yesterday.</li>
        <li>She bought a new laptop last week.</li>
        <li>They watched a film at home.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can add extra information after the object. This extra information usually answers the questions: how,
        where, when, and why.
      </p>

      <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + Manner + Place + Time + Purpose</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p class="example">
        I wrote my essay carefully in my room last night because I wanted to improve my writing.
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> I</li>
        <li><strong>Verb:</strong> wrote</li>
        <li><strong>Object:</strong> my essay</li>
        <li><strong>Manner:</strong> carefully (how?)</li>
        <li><strong>Place:</strong> in my room (where?)</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> last night (when?)</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> because I wanted to improve my writing (why?)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need to include all these parts every time, but the order is important. English likes stable
        patterns. If you put the parts in a strange order, the sentence feels uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>She studied English hard at home last weekend to prepare for the exam.</li>
        <li>They discussed the problem calmly in the office yesterday afternoon.</li>
        <li>We met our friends in the park on Saturday to celebrate his birthday.</li>
      </ul>
