      <h1>Clauses, Phrases, and Sentences</h1>
      <p class="unit-intro">
        Before we can write clear, elegant essays, we must first understand what English writing is built on — the
        sentence. Every sentence has a structure, and that structure depends on <strong>clauses</strong> and
        <strong>phrases</strong>. Think of them as building blocks of meaning. Once you know how to use these blocks,
        you can build anything — from a short, simple sentence to a long, beautifully connected paragraph.

      <!-- 1. What is a clause? -->
      <section id="what-is-a-clause" class="unit-section">
        <h2>1. What Is a Clause?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a <strong>subject</strong> and a
          <strong>verb</strong>. That’s the key:
        </p>

        <p class="formula">subject + verb = clause</p>

        <h3>Independent Clauses</h3>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
          <li>She is reading a book.</li>
          <li>We went to the beach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are complete thoughts because they tell us <em>who</em> is doing something and <em>what</em> they are
          doing. These are called <strong>independent clauses</strong> — they can stand alone.
        </p>

        <h3>Dependent Clauses</h3>
        <p>Now compare these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I studied hard</li>
          <li>When it stopped raining</li>
          <li>Although I wasn’t hungry</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These also contain a subject and a verb, but they don’t express a complete idea. They are
          <strong>dependent clauses</strong> — they depend on another clause to make sense.
        </p>

        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</li>
          <li>When it stopped raining, we went outside.</li>
          <li>Although I wasn’t hungry, I ate a slice of cake.</li>
        </ul>

              <li>Needs another clause to complete the meaning</li>

      <section id="what-is-a-phrase" class="unit-section">
        <h2>3. What Is a Phrase?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of words that has meaning but does not have both a subject and a verb.
          It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
        </p>

        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The big blue house at the end of the road</li>
          <li>In the middle of the night</li>
          <li>To find a better job</li>
          <li>With great enthusiasm</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A phrase adds colour or detail, but it cannot be the sentence itself.</p>

        <h2>4. What Is a Sentence?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A subject</li>
          <li>A verb</li>
          <li>A complete idea</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A correct sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark.
        </p>

        <ul class="example-list">
          <li><strong>Correct:</strong> I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
          <li><strong>Correct:</strong> She loves writing essays.</li>
          <li><strong>Not correct:</strong> Because I studied hard.</li>

        <h2>5. Understanding Sentence Patterns</h2>
        <p>English follows a typical word order:</p>

        <p class="formula">Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra information)</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p class="example">
          I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.
        </p>

        <ul class="breakdown-list">
          <li><strong>Subject:</strong> I</li>
          <li><strong>Verb:</strong> ate</li>
          <li><strong>Object:</strong> my pizza</li>
          <li><strong>Manner:</strong> quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> in the car</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> last night</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> because I was in a hurry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>English keeps the subject and verb near the start.</p>
