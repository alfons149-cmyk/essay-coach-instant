    <h1>Clauses, Phrases, and Sentences</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      Before we can write clear, elegant essays, we must first understand what English writing is built on —
      <strong>the sentence</strong>. Every sentence has a structure, and that structure depends on
      <strong>clauses</strong> and <strong>phrases</strong>. Think of them as the building blocks of meaning.
      Once you know how to use these blocks, you can build anything — from a short, simple sentence
      to a long, beautifully connected paragraph.

    <!-- 1. What is a clause -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-clause">
      <h2>1. What Is a Clause?</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a <strong>subject</strong> and a
        <strong>verb</strong>. That’s the key:
      </p>

      <p class="formula"><strong>subject + verb = clause</strong></p>

      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
        <li>She is reading a book.</li>
        <li>We went to the beach.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All three are complete thoughts because they tell us <em>who</em> is doing something and
        <em>what</em> they are doing. These are called <strong>independent clauses</strong> because
        they can stand alone.
      </p>

      <p>Now look at these examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because I studied hard</li>
        <li>When it stopped raining</li>
        <li>Although I wasn’t hungry</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They also contain a subject and a verb, but they don’t express a complete idea — you are left waiting
        for more information. These are <strong>dependent clauses</strong> because they rely on another clause to
        complete the meaning.
      </p>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</li>
        <li>When it stopped raining, we went outside.</li>
        <li>Although I wasn’t hungry, I ate a slice of cake.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> A clause is like a small sentence that sometimes needs a friend.
      </p>

    <!-- 2. Types of clauses -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-types-clauses">
      <h2>2. Types of Clauses</h2>

      <h3>Independent Clause (IC)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can stand alone</li>
        <li>Expresses a complete thought</li>
        <li>Always has a subject + verb</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> I love studying English.</p>

      <h3>Dependent Clause (DC)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cannot stand alone</li>
        <li>Starts with a subordinating word: because, although, when, if, unless, while…</li>
        <li>Needs another clause to complete meaning</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Because I love studying English, I spend time writing every day.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. What is a phrase -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-phrase">
      <h2>3. What Is a Phrase?</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of words that has meaning but does <strong>not</strong> contain both a
        subject and a verb. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
      </p>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The big blue house at the end of the road</li>
        <li>In the middle of the night</li>
        <li>To find a better job</li>
        <li>With great enthusiasm</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A phrase adds colour to a sentence, but it cannot be the sentence itself.</p>

      <h3>Phrases Inside Sentences</h3>

      <table class="phrase-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Phrase</th>
          <th>Sentence Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>At the end of the road</td>
          <td>There is a shop at the end of the road.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>To find a better job</td>
          <td>She moved to London to find a better job.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>With great enthusiasm</td>
          <td>The students greeted their teacher with great enthusiasm.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Each phrase adds meaning — about <em>place</em>, <em>purpose</em>, or <em>manner</em> — but the core sentence still
        depends on the clause (subject + verb).

    <!-- 4. What is a sentence -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-sentence">
      <h2>4. What Is a Sentence?</h2>

      <p>A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a subject</li>
        <li>a verb</li>
        <li>a complete idea</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A correct sentence always:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starts with a capital letter</li>
        <li>Ends with a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I play tennis every Saturday.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>She loves writing essays.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Because I studied hard.</p>

      <p><strong>Corrected:</strong> Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</p>

    <!-- 5. Sentence patterns -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-patterns">
      <h2>5. Understanding Sentence Patterns</h2>

      <p>English usually follows this pattern:</p>
      <p class="formula"><strong>Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra Information)</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> I</li>
        <li><strong>Verb:</strong> ate</li>
        <li><strong>Object:</strong> my pizza</li>
        <li><strong>Manner:</strong> quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> in the car</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> last night</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> because I was in a hurry</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Good vs. unnatural word order:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yesterday, I ate my pizza… <span class="ok">✔</span></li>
        <li>I yesterday ate my pizza… <span class="bad">✘</span></li>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-two-types">
      <h2>6. Two Basic Sentence Types in English</h2>

      <h3>(a) Verbs of Motion</h3>
      <p>go, come, drive, fly, walk, run, travel, move</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>I went to the city centre by bus this morning to buy myself a new shirt.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Who: I</li>
        <li>Verb: went</li>
        <li>Where: to the city centre</li>
        <li>How: by bus</li>
        <li>When: this morning</li>
        <li>Why: to buy myself a new shirt</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>(b) No-Motion Verbs</h3>
      <p>eat, make, study, watch, have, enjoy, write</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night…</p>

      <p>Pattern:</p>
      <p class="formula">
        <strong>Subject → Verb → Object → Manner → Location → Time → Purpose</strong>

    <!-- 7. Types of sentences -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-types-sentences">
      <h2>7. Types of Sentences</h2>

      <p>To write advanced Cambridge essays, you must use a <strong>variety</strong> of sentence types.</p>

      <h3>a) Simple Sentence</h3>
      <p>One independent clause.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I study English every day.</li>
        <li>The exam starts at nine o’clock.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>b) Compound Sentence</h3>
      <p>Two independent clauses joined by a connector.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I studied hard, and I passed the exam.</li>
        <li>The weather was bad, but we still went for a walk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>c) Complex Sentence</h3>
      <p>One independent clause + one dependent clause.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Because it was my birthday, we ate out at a restaurant.</p>

      <h3>d) Compound–Complex Sentence</h3>
      <p>At least two independent clauses + one dependent clause.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Because I had a headache, I went home, and I took an aspirin.</p>

    <!-- 8. Connecting clauses -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-connectors">
      <h2>8. Connecting Your Clauses</h2>

      <p>You can join clauses using:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coordinating conjunctions:</strong> for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</li>
        <li><strong>Conjunctive adverbs:</strong> however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, meanwhile</li>
        <li><strong>Subordinating conjunctions:</strong> because, although, when, unless, while, since, if…</li>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-putting">
      <h2>9. Putting It All Together</h2>

      <p><strong>Example paragraph:</strong></p>

      <p>
        In England, there are speed limits clearly displayed on the roads to show the maximum speed you should
        drive. Some drivers just don’t seem to notice these, and they treat every trip as a race, overtaking in
        dangerous places like on a blind bend. The speed limits are there for a reason, and it’s always worrying
        to see people driving like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paragraph uses a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences, plus precise phrases to add detail.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 10. Quick practice -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u1-practice">
      <h2>10. Quick Practice</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Identify the clause type:<br>
          a) When I was young, I loved reading fairy tales.<br>
          b) I love reading fairy tales.<br>
          c) Because I love fairy tales.
        </li>

        <li>
          Complete the sentence:<br>
          <em>Although it was raining… → Although it was raining, we decided to go out.</em>
        </li>

        <li>
          Combine:<br>
          <em>I was tired. I finished my homework. → Although I was tired, I finished my homework.</em>

      <h2>11. Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        You’ve just taken the first step toward mastering essay writing. Understanding
        <strong>clauses, phrases, and sentences</strong> is like learning how to build a house. If the foundations are
        strong, everything else — paragraphs, essays, and even exam tasks — becomes easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, we’ll go further and look at <strong>word order</strong> and how sentence parts move to create
        emphasis, variety, and flow — the kind of language that makes your writing stand out in Cambridge exams.
      </p>

      <p><em>Clear sentences lead to clear ideas. And clear ideas lead to confident writing.</em></p>
