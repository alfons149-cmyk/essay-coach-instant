<h2>Unit 1: Clauses, Phrases, and Sentences</h2>

<p>
  Before we can write clear, elegant essays, we must first understand what English writing is built on –
  the sentence. Every sentence has a structure, and that structure depends on <strong>clauses</strong> and
  <strong>phrases</strong>. Think of them as the building blocks of meaning. Once you know how to use these
  blocks, you can build anything – from a short, simple sentence to a long, beautifully connected paragraph.
</p>

<p>Let’s take this step by step.</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. What Is a Clause?</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a <strong>subject</strong> and a <strong>verb</strong>.
  That’s the key:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
  subject + verb = clause
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
  <li>She is reading a book.</li>
  <li>We went to the beach.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All three are complete thoughts because they tell us <em>who</em> is doing something and <em>what</em> they
  are doing. These are called <strong>independent clauses</strong> because they can stand alone.
</p>

<p>Now look at these examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because I studied hard</li>
  <li>When it stopped raining</li>
  <li>Although I wasn’t hungry</li>
</ul>

<p>
  They also contain a subject and a verb, but they don’t express a complete idea. You’re left waiting for more
  information. These are called <strong>dependent clauses</strong>, because they depend on another part of the
  sentence to make sense.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</li>
  <li>When it stopped raining, we went outside.</li>
  <li>Although I wasn’t hungry, I ate a slice of cake.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each sentence now feels complete – because the dependent clause connects with an independent one.
  A good way to remember it:
</p>

<p><em>A clause is like a small sentence that sometimes needs a friend.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Types of Clauses</h3>

<h4>Independent Clause (IC)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Can stand alone.</li>
  <li>Expresses a complete thought.</li>
  <li>Always has a subject and a verb.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> I love studying English.</p>

<h4>Dependent Clause (DC)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Cannot stand alone.</li>
  <li>Often starts with a subordinating word like <em>because, although, when, if, unless, while</em>.</li>
  <li>Needs another clause to complete the meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Because I love studying English, I spend time writing every day.</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. What Is a Phrase?</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of words that has meaning but does <em>not</em> have both a subject and a verb.
  That means it cannot stand alone as a sentence.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The big blue house at the end of the road</li>
  <li>In the middle of the night</li>
  <li>To find a better job</li>
  <li>With great enthusiasm</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of these phrases gives us information – about <strong>where</strong>, <strong>when</strong>,
  <strong>why</strong>, or <strong>how</strong> – but none can form a sentence on its own.
</p>

<p><em>A phrase adds colour to a sentence, but it cannot be the sentence itself.</em></p>

<p>Now look at how phrases fit into sentences:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Phrase</th>
      <th>Sentence Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>At the end of the road</td>
      <td>There is a shop at the end of the road.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>To find a better job</td>
      <td>She moved to London to find a better job.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>With great enthusiasm</td>
      <td>The students greeted their teacher with great enthusiasm.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Each phrase gives extra meaning – about <strong>place</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong>, or
  <strong>manner</strong> – but the core of the sentence still depends on the clause (the part with subject + verb).
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. What Is a Sentence?</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a subject (who or what the sentence is about)</li>
  <li>a verb (what the subject does)</li>
  <li>and it must make complete sense on its own.</li>
</ul>

<p>A correct sentence always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starts with a capital letter.</li>
  <li>Ends with a full stop (<code>.</code>), question mark (<code>?</code>) or exclamation mark (<code>!</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>✅ <em>I play tennis every Saturday.</em>  
(Subject: <strong>I</strong> | Verb: <strong>play</strong> | Complete idea)</p>

<p>✅ <em>She loves writing essays.</em>  
(Subject: <strong>She</strong> | Verb: <strong>loves</strong> | Complete idea)</p>

<p>❌ <em>Because I studied hard.</em>  
This is <em>not</em> a full sentence – it’s a dependent clause and leaves the reader waiting.</p>

<p>You can fix it like this:</p>

<p>✅ <em>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Understanding Sentence Patterns</h3>

<p>
  English has a relatively fixed word order. We usually follow this pattern:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
  Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra information)
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><em>I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.</em></p>

<p>Now, let’s label it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject: <strong>I</strong></li>
  <li>Verb: <strong>ate</strong></li>
  <li>Object: <strong>my pizza</strong></li>
  <li>Manner: <strong>quickly</strong></li>
  <li>Location: <strong>in the car</strong></li>
  <li>Time: <strong>last night</strong></li>
  <li>Purpose: <strong>because I was in a hurry</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  English usually keeps the subject and verb together near the start. You can move the time phrase sometimes, but
  most other parts stay in a fairly fixed order.
</p>

<p>✅ Yesterday, I ate my pizza quickly in the car because I was in a hurry.<br>
❌ I yesterday ate my pizza quickly in the car.</p>

<p>
  You can think of English word order as the <strong>backbone</strong> of your writing. Once you know it, you can add
  details confidently.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Two Basic Sentence Patterns in English</h3>

<p>There are two main sentence patterns you’ll use again and again:</p>

<h4>(a) Sentences with verbs of motion</h4>

<p>
  These are verbs like <em>go, come, drive, fly, walk, run, travel, move</em> – verbs that show movement.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><em>I went to the city centre by bus this morning to buy myself a new shirt.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject: <strong>I</strong></li>
  <li>Verb: <strong>went</strong></li>
  <li>Location: <strong>to the city centre</strong></li>
  <li>Manner: <strong>by bus</strong></li>
  <li>Time: <strong>this morning</strong></li>
  <li>Purpose: <strong>to buy myself a new shirt</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>More examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>She flew to Paris on Monday to visit her aunt.</li>
  <li>We walked to school slowly in the rain.</li>
  <li>They drove to Madrid last weekend for a concert.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Who → What (verb) → Where → How → When → Why</p>

<h4>(b) Sentences with verbs of no motion</h4>

<p>
  These are verbs like <em>eat, make, study, watch, have, enjoy, write</em> – actions that don’t involve movement.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><em>I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Subject → Verb → Object → Manner → Location → Time → Purpose</p>

<p>Try these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>She read the letter carefully at her desk this morning.</li>
  <li>We watched the movie together at home yesterday because it was raining.</li>
  <li>He finished his report quietly in the office before the meeting.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>7. Types of Sentences</h3>

<p>
  To write essays that sound advanced, you must use <strong>different sentence types</strong>.
  Cambridge examiners reward <strong>variety</strong> – not all your sentences should look the same.
</p>

<h4>a) Simple Sentence</h4>

<p>A simple sentence has just <strong>one independent clause</strong> and one subject.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I study English every day.</li>
  <li>My teacher is very kind and will do anything to help his students.</li>
  <li>The exam starts at nine o’clock.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple sentences are clear and direct. Use them when you want to make a strong point.</p>

<h4>b) Compound Sentence</h4>

<p>
  A compound sentence has <strong>two independent clauses</strong> joined by a connector. It expresses two related
  ideas.
</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I studied hard, and I passed the exam.</li>
  <li>The weather was bad, but we still went for a walk.</li>
  <li>You can stay here, or you can go home.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can join the two parts using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Coordinating conjunctions:</strong> for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</li>
  <li><strong>Semicolons:</strong> <code>;</code> when the ideas are very close.</li>
  <li><strong>Conjunctive adverbs:</strong> however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, meanwhile, indeed…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples with semicolons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I worked very hard on my essay; it went very well.</li>
  <li>The restaurant was busy; we decided to eat somewhere else.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Using a semicolon gives a strong emphasis to the second clause. It makes the second clause feel more important
  than the first. Compound sentences show control and balance – perfect for Cambridge writing.
</p>

<h4>c) Complex Sentence</h4>

<p>
  A complex sentence has <strong>one independent clause</strong> and one or more <strong>dependent clauses</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Because it was my birthday, we ate out at a restaurant.</li>
  <li>I’ll call you when I arrive.</li>
  <li>Although she was tired, she continued studying.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These sentences are powerful because they show relationships between ideas – cause and effect, contrast, time,
  or condition.
</p>

<h4>d) Compound–Complex Sentence</h4>

<p>
  A compound–complex sentence combines both types: it has <strong>at least two independent clauses</strong> and
  <strong>one dependent clause</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Because I had a headache, I went home, and I took an aspirin.</li>
  <li>We stayed at the hotel because it was raining, and we were too tired to drive.</li>
  <li>Although I wasn’t hungry, I ate the sandwich, and I drank some tea.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These sentences are common in advanced writing. They allow you to express ideas with precision – showing
  connection, reason, and result all at once.
</p>

<h3>8. Connecting Your Clauses: Conjunctions and Adverbs</h3>

<p>You can join clauses with three main tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Coordinating conjunctions</strong> – for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so<br>
    <em>I wanted to go for a swim, but it was too cold.</em><br>
    <em>She studied hard, so she passed the test.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Conjunctive adverbs</strong> – however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, meanwhile, indeed…<br>
    <em>I wanted to go for a swim; however, I was too busy.</em><br>
    <em>He didn’t study; therefore, he failed the exam.</em><br>
    <em>You do the cooking; meanwhile, I’ll tidy the room.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Subordinating conjunctions</strong> – because, although, when, unless, while, since, if, etc.<br>
    <em>Because it was late, we went home.</em><br>
    <em>Although I was tired, I kept working.</em><br>
    <em>If it rains, we’ll stay inside.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  By mastering connectors, you’ll write sentences that flow naturally from one idea to the next.
</p>

<h3>9. Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>Let’s see how this looks in real writing:</p>

<p>
  <em>
    In England, there are speed limits clearly displayed on the roads to show the maximum speed you should drive.
    Some drivers just don’t seem to notice these, and they treat every trip as a race, overtaking in dangerous places
    like on a blind bend. The speed limits are there for a reason, and it’s always worrying to see people driving like
    this.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  This paragraph uses a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences, plus precise phrases (in dangerous places,
  on a blind bend) to add detail. That’s what you should aim for in your essays – balance, rhythm, and clarity.
</p>

<h3>10. Quick Practice</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Identify the clause type:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When I was young, I loved reading fairy tales.</li>
      <li>I love reading fairy tales.</li>
      <li>Because I love fairy tales.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add an independent clause to complete the thought:</strong><br>
    Although it was raining… → <em>Although it was raining, we decided to go out.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Combine these into one complex sentence:</strong><br>
    I was tired. I finished my homework.<br>
    → <em>Although I was tired, I finished my homework.</em>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>11. Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
  You’ve just taken the first step toward mastering essay writing. Understanding
  <strong>clauses</strong>, <strong>phrases</strong>, and <strong>sentences</strong> is like learning how to build a
  house. If the foundations are strong, everything else – paragraphs, essays, and even exam tasks – becomes easier and
  more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
  In the next unit, we’ll go further and look at <strong>word order</strong> and how sentence parts can move to create
  emphasis, variety, and flow – the kind of language that makes your writing stand out in Cambridge exams.
</p>

<p><em>Remember: Clear sentences lead to clear ideas. And clear ideas lead to confident writing.</em></p>
