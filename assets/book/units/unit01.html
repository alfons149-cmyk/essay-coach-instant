<h1>Unit 1 — Clauses, Phrases, and Sentences</h1>

<p>
Before we can write clear, elegant essays, we must first understand what English writing is built on — 
<strong>the sentence</strong>.  
Every sentence has a structure, and that structure depends on <strong>clauses</strong> and <strong>phrases</strong>.
Think of them as building blocks of meaning. Once you know how to use these blocks, you can build anything — 
from a short, simple sentence to a long, beautifully connected paragraph.
</p>

<h2>1. What Is a Clause?</h2>

<p>
A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that contains a <strong>subject</strong> and a <strong>verb</strong>.  
That’s the key:
</p>

<p class="definition"><strong>subject + verb = clause</strong></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I play tennis every Saturday.</li>
  <li>She is reading a book.</li>
  <li>We went to the beach.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are complete thoughts because they tell us <em>who</em> is doing something and <em>what</em> they are doing.
These are called <strong>independent clauses</strong> — they can stand alone.
</p>

<p>Now compare these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because I studied hard</li>
  <li>When it stopped raining</li>
  <li>Although I wasn’t hungry</li>
</ul>

<p>
These also contain a subject and a verb, but they don’t express a complete idea.  
They are <strong>dependent clauses</strong> — they depend on another clause to make sense.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</li>
  <li>When it stopped raining, we went outside.</li>
  <li>Although I wasn’t hungry, I ate a slice of cake.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> A clause is like a small sentence that sometimes needs a friend.</p>

<h2>2. Types of Clauses</h2>

<h3>Independent Clause (IC)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Can stand alone</li>
  <li>Expresses a complete thought</li>
  <li>Has a subject + verb</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> I love studying English.</p>

<h3>Dependent Clause (DC)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cannot stand alone</li>
  <li>Begins with a subordinating word (because, although, when, unless, while, since, if…)</li>
  <li>Needs another clause to complete the meaning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Because I love studying English, I write every day.</p>

<h2>3. What Is a Phrase?</h2>

<p>
A <strong>phrase</strong> is a group of words that has meaning but does <em>not</em> have both a subject and a verb.  
It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The big blue house at the end of the road</li>
  <li>In the middle of the night</li>
  <li>To find a better job</li>
  <li>With great enthusiasm</li>
</ul>

<p>
A phrase adds colour or detail, but it cannot be the sentence itself.
</p>

<h3>Phrases Inside Sentences</h3>

  <tr><th>Phrase</th><th>Sentence Example</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the end of the road</td>
    <td>There is a shop at the end of the road.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To find a better job</td>
    <td>She moved to London to find a better job.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With great enthusiasm</td>
    <td>The students greeted their teacher with great enthusiasm.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>4. What Is a Sentence?</h2>

<p>
A <strong>sentence</strong> is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
It must have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A subject</li>
  <li>A verb</li>
  <li>A complete idea</li>
</ul>

<p>
A correct sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark.
</p>

<p><strong>Correct:</strong> I play tennis every Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> She loves writing essays.</p>

<p><strong>Not correct:</strong> Because I studied hard.</p>

<p>Fix:</p>
<p><strong>Because I studied hard, I passed my exam.</strong></p>

<h2>5. Understanding Sentence Patterns</h2>

<p>English follows a typical word order:</p>

<p class="definition"><strong>Subject + Verb + Object + (Extra information)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subject:</strong> I</li>
  <li><strong>Verb:</strong> ate</li>
  <li><strong>Object:</strong> my pizza</li>
  <li><strong>Manner:</strong> quickly</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> in the car</li>
  <li><strong>Time:</strong> last night</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> because I was in a hurry</li>
</ul>

<p>English keeps the subject and verb near the start.</p>

<h2>6. Two Basic Sentence Types</h2>

<h3>(a) Verbs of Motion</h3>
<p>go, come, drive, fly, walk, run, travel, move</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>I went to the city centre by bus this morning to buy myself a new shirt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who: I</li>
  <li>Verb: went</li>
  <li>Where: to the city centre</li>
  <li>How: by bus</li>
  <li>When: this morning</li>
  <li>Why: to buy myself a new shirt</li>
</ul>

<h3>(b) No-Motion Verbs</h3>
<p>eat, make, study, watch, have, enjoy, write</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>I ate my pizza quickly in the car last night because I was in a hurry.</p>

<h2>7. Types of Sentences</h2>

<h3>Simple Sentence</h3>
<p>One independent clause.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I study English every day.</li>
  <li>The exam starts at nine o’clock.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compound Sentence</h3>
<p>Two independent clauses joined by a connector.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> I studied hard, and I passed the exam.</p>

<h3>Complex Sentence</h3>
<p>One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Because it was my birthday, we ate at a restaurant.</p>

<h3>Compound–Complex Sentence</h3>
<p>Two independent clauses + at least one dependent clause.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Because I had a headache, I went home, and I took an aspirin.</p>

<h2>8. Connecting Your Clauses</h2>

<p>Use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coordinating conjunctions:</strong> for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so</li>
  <li><strong>Conjunctive adverbs:</strong> however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, meanwhile</li>
  <li><strong>Subordinating conjunctions:</strong> because, although, when, unless, while, since, if</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>Good writing mixes sentence types to create flow and clarity.</p>

<blockquote>
In England, there are speed limits clearly displayed on the roads to show the maximum speed you
should drive. Some drivers just don’t seem to notice these, and they treat every trip as a race,
overtaking in dangerous places like on a blind bend. The speed limits are there for a reason, and
it’s always worrying to see people driving like this.
</blockquote>

<h2>10. Quick Practice</h2>

<p><strong>1. Identify the clause type:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>When I was young, I loved reading fairy tales.</em></li>
  <li><em>I love reading fairy tales.</em></li>
  <li><em>Because I love fairy tales.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Complete the sentence:</strong><br>
<em>Although it was raining…</em> → Although it was raining, we decided to go out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Combine:</strong><br>
I was tired. I finished my homework.  
→ Although I was tired, I finished my homework.</p>

<h2>11. Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
Understanding <strong>clauses</strong>, <strong>phrases</strong>, and <strong>sentences</strong> is like learning how to build a house.  
If the foundations are strong, everything else — paragraphs, essays, and exam tasks — becomes easier.
