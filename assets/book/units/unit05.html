<h2>Unit 5: From Simple to Stylish Sentences</h2>

<p>
  By now, you know how to write correct sentences: you can place the subject and verb correctly,
  use connectors, and control basic punctuation. In this unit we go one step further. We move from
  sentences that are simply <strong>correct</strong> to sentences that are <strong>stylish</strong>:
  natural, varied, and confident.
</p>

<p>
  Stylish sentences are what make your writing sound like it belongs at B2, C1 or C2 level in a
  Cambridge exam.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. What Makes a Sentence Stylish?</h3>

<p>A stylish sentence usually does three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It communicates the idea clearly.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>It sounds natural</strong> – like something an educated speaker would genuinely say or write.</li>
  <li><strong>It has variety</strong> – in length, structure, and rhythm.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Think of writing like music. If every sentence has the same rhythm, your paragraph becomes
  monotonous. If you mix short and long sentences, the “melody” of your writing becomes more
  interesting and pleasant to read.
</p>

<p><strong>Flat version</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Students need to study. They must write every day. They should read examples. They must check
  their work.
</em></p>

<p><strong>More stylish version</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Students do need to study, but that is only the starting point. Writing every day builds confidence,
  and reading strong examples shows what effective essays look like. Above all, checking their own
  work teaches responsibility.
</em></p>

<p>Both versions are correct. Only one sounds like real, thoughtful writing.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Step One: Vary Your Sentence Length</h3>

<p>
  Short sentences create impact. Long sentences create flow and explanation. Good writing needs
  <strong>both</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Short sentence = power.</strong>  
    <em>Failure is part of success.</em><br>
    <em>Everyone starts somewhere.</em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Long sentence = development.</strong>  
    <em>Failure is part of success because it forces us to adjust, try again, and move forward with
    more experience.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When you combine them, you create rhythm. For example:
</p>

<p><em>
  Writing well takes time. It isn’t about perfection, but about progress – and progress begins when
  you practise regularly.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Practical tip</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Read your paragraph out loud.</li>
  <li>If you hear the same rhythm again and again, change one sentence.</li>
  <li>Combine two very short sentences. Split one very long sentence in two.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  That is how your writing begins to sound natural and alive.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Step Two: Play with Sentence Openings</h3>

<p>
  Many learners start almost every sentence like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I think…</em></li>
  <li><em>People believe…</em></li>
  <li><em>There is…</em></li>
  <li><em>It is…</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are not wrong, but repeated again and again they feel mechanical. To sound more advanced,
  learn to change the way your sentences begin.
</p>

<h4>3.1 Use -ing phrases</h4>

<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <em>-ing phrase + comma + main clause</em></p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Starting a new language can feel difficult at first,</em> but regular practice makes it easier.</li>
  <li><em>Living in another country,</em> students quickly realise how important communication is.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.2 Use prepositional phrases</h4>

<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: <em>Preposition + noun phrase + comma + main clause</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>In the modern world,</em> technology dominates communication.</li>
  <li><em>At school,</em> we often forget that writing is a form of thinking.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3 Use adverbs</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Interestingly,</em> many people only write when they are forced to.</li>
  <li><em>Unfortunately,</em> some students see writing as a punishment rather than a skill.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4 Use clauses</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Although learning takes effort,</em> the reward is confidence.</li>
  <li><em>When teachers give clear models,</em> students feel less afraid of writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Mixing these openings keeps the reader interested and shows the examiner that you can control
  structure instead of repeating the same pattern.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Step Three: Use Parallel Structure</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Parallel structure</strong> means giving similar ideas the same grammatical form. It is like
  good design in writing: everything lines up.
</p>

<p><strong>Not parallel</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We must plan carefully, write with thought, and our editing should be precise.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parallel and better</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We must plan carefully, write thoughtfully, and edit precisely.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More examples</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The course teaches students to read critically, think independently, and argue persuasively.</li>
  <li>Success in writing requires patience, discipline, and imagination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Parallelism creates a hidden rhythm in your sentences. It is especially powerful in lists and when
  you want to emphasise three key points.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Step Four: Combine and Compress Ideas</h3>

<p>
  Early writing often uses many short, separate sentences. To sound more advanced, you need to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>combine</strong> ideas with connectors, and</li>
  <li><strong>compress</strong> full clauses into phrases when possible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.1 Combining ideas</h4>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>❌ <em>I studied hard. I passed the test.</em></li>
  <li>✅ <em>I studied hard, so I passed the test.</em></li>
  <li>✅ <em>Because I studied hard, I passed the test.</em></li>
  <li>✅ <em>Having studied hard, I passed the test.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each new version feels smoother and more natural. You move from simple statements to connected,
  logical sentences.
</p>

<h4>5.2 Compressing clauses into phrases</h4>

<p>You can often reduce a full clause to a shorter phrase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>When I was a child, I loved stories.</em><br>
    → <em>As a child, I loved stories.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Because she didn’t know the rules, she made mistakes.</em><br>
    → <em>Unaware of the rules, she made mistakes.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>If you practise every day, you will improve.</em><br>
    → <em>With daily practice, you will improve.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This technique adds elegance and concision — two clear signs of more advanced writing.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Step Five: Cut Clutter and Strengthen Style</h3>

<p>
  Stylish sentences are often shorter than you expect. They remove unnecessary words and avoid
  fixed phrases that add length but not meaning.
</p>

<h4>6.1 Remove empty phrases</h4>

<p>❌ <em>In today’s modern society of today, people should try to make efforts to reduce pollution.</em></p>
<p>✅ <em>Today, people should reduce pollution.</em></p>

<h4>6.2 Avoid overusing “there is / there are”</h4>

<p>❌ <em>There are many reasons why people learn English.</em></p>
<p>✅ <em>People learn English for many reasons.</em></p>

<h4>6.3 Replace vague verbs with stronger ones</h4>

<p>❌ <em>Many students <strong>do</strong> mistakes in their essays.</em></p>
<p>✅ <em>Many students <strong>make</strong> mistakes in their essays.</em></p>

<p>❌ <em>The teacher <strong>did</strong> a decision.</em></p>
<p>✅ <em>The teacher <strong>made</strong> a decision.</em></p>

<p>
  You do not need complicated vocabulary to sound advanced. Clear structure, precise verbs, and
  fewer empty phrases already make a big difference.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Step Six: Create Flow Between Sentences</h3>

<p>
  Stylish writing is not only about individual sentences; it is about how they
  <strong>connect</strong>. This is called <strong>sentence cohesion</strong>.
</p>

<p>Good writers often:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick up a key word or idea from the previous sentence and repeat or reformulate it</li>
  <li>use pronouns (<em>this, these, it, they</em>) to refer back to ideas</li>
  <li>use subtle connectors (<em>as a result, in contrast, for this reason</em>) instead of starting every sentence with “Also” or “But”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p><em>
  Language connects us. Through words, we build relationships, express our thoughts, and shape
  our world. Without it, we lose connection. Without connection, we lose understanding.
</em></p>

<p>
  Can you hear the rhythm? Short → long → short → short. The repeated idea
  (<em>connection</em>) holds the paragraph together.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Common Style Problems (and How to Fix Them)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Many very short sentences in a row.<br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Combine related ideas with <em>and, but, so</em> or with subordinators such as
    <em>because, although, when</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Every sentence starts the same way.<br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Use -ing phrases, prepositional phrases, adverbs, and clauses to vary openings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Wordy, repetitive expressions.<br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Remove empty phrases (<em>in today’s modern society of today</em>) and go straight
    to the point.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Lists without parallel structure.<br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Make the grammar of each item match the others.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>9. Practice: Upgrade Your Sentences</h3>

<p>Try these short activities to put Unit 5 into action.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Vary sentence length.</strong><br>
    Write three very short sentences about studying English. Then join at least two of them into a
    longer sentence using a connector.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Change the opening.</strong><br>
    Take this sentence: <em>I think technology is useful in education.</em><br>
    Rewrite it three times with different openings (for example, with an -ing phrase, a prepositional
    phrase, and a subordinate clause).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make it parallel.</strong><br>
    Improve this list: <em>The course helps students to improve their grammar, writing better, and
    they speak more fluently.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cut the clutter.</strong><br>
    Simplify: <em>In our modern world of today, there are many different reasons why people decide to
    learn English.</em>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>10. Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
  Style isn’t about showing off. It’s about clarity, rhythm, and confidence – the difference between
  writing just to finish a task and writing to be understood.
</p>

<p>
  You do not need rare vocabulary to sound advanced. What examiners really notice is control:
  well-shaped sentences, varied rhythm, and thoughtful word choice.
</p>

<p><em>
  Correct writing is good. Connected, stylish writing is excellent.
</em></p>

<p>
  In the next unit, we will go deeper into <strong>word choice and vocabulary precision</strong> – how to
  select the right word for every situation and how to replace “very” with expressions that give
  your writing colour, control, and power.
