    <h1>Building Strong Paragraphs</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In Cambridge essays, the paragraph is your basic building block. If your paragraphs are clear,
      focused, and well developed, your whole essay will feel organised and easy to follow.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, you’ll learn how to build effective paragraphs using <strong>topic sentences</strong>,
      <strong>supporting ideas</strong>, and <strong>examples</strong>, and how to avoid common problems such as
      weak starts, random ideas, and underdeveloped points.

      <h2>1. What Is a Paragraph?</h2>

      <p>
        A <strong>paragraph</strong> is a group of sentences that develop <strong>one main idea</strong>.
        In Cambridge essays, each main body paragraph normally:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>begins with a <strong>topic sentence</strong>,</li>
        <li>explains that idea with <strong>supporting sentences</strong>,</li>
        <li>adds <strong>examples or evidence</strong>,</li>
        <li>sometimes finishes with a short <strong>mini-conclusion</strong> or link.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a paragraph has too many different ideas, it feels messy. If it has only one or two short sentences,
        it feels underdeveloped.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Topic sentences -->
    <section id="u5-topic-sentences" class="unit-section">
      <h2>2. Topic Sentences</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>topic sentence</strong> is usually the first sentence of a paragraph. It tells the reader:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>what the paragraph is about, and</li>
        <li>what you want to say about that topic.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Weak topic sentence:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Technology is very important nowadays.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Better topic sentence:</strong></p>
        <p><em>One major advantage of technology in education is that it gives students instant access to information.</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The second version is better because it is <strong>specific</strong>. It prepares the reader for a paragraph
        about <em>access to information</em>, not about “technology” in general.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Good topic sentences often:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>include a clear <strong>controlling idea</strong> (one main focus),</li>
        <li>avoid vague phrases like “a lot of things” or “some advantages”,</li>
        <li>match the task and the paragraph’s function (argument, example, explanation).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Support and development -->
    <section id="u5-support" class="unit-section">
      <h2>3. Support and Development</h2>

      <p>
        After the topic sentence, you need to <strong>develop</strong> the idea. This is where many students lose
        marks: they give a good idea, but they do not explain it or support it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Think in three layers:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Point</strong> – your main idea (topic sentence).</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation</strong> – why / how / in what way?</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong> – a simple, clear illustration.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Point:</strong></p>
        <p><em>One advantage of online learning is flexibility.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Students can choose when to study, which makes it easier to combine courses with work or family responsibilities.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p><em>For instance, many adults take evening webinars after work instead of having to travel to a physical classroom.</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Notice how the explanation and example <strong>stay focused</strong> on the same idea: flexibility in online learning.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Unity and coherence -->
    <section id="u5-unity" class="unit-section">
      <h2>4. Unity and Coherence</h2>

      <p>
        A strong paragraph has both <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>coherence</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unity</strong> = every sentence supports the topic sentence.</li>
        <li><strong>Coherence</strong> = sentences are connected in a logical order.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Paragraph with weak unity:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            One advantage of online learning is flexibility. Students can watch lessons when they have time.
            Some people also think traditional schools should teach more life skills. Online courses are often cheaper.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Improved version:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            One advantage of online learning is flexibility. Students can watch lessons when they have time, rather
            than following a fixed timetable. This makes it easier to combine study with work or family responsibilities.
            As a result, many adults choose online courses instead of travelling to evening classes.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the improved version, every sentence supports the same idea and the logic is clear: advantage → explanation → result.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Model exam paragraph -->
    <section id="u5-model" class="unit-section">
      <h2>5. Model Exam Paragraph</h2>

      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Some people say that reading books is no longer important because we can get information online.
      Do you agree?</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Model paragraph:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>
            One reason why reading books is still important is that it develops deeper concentration than online texts.
            When students read a book, they usually focus on one author’s ideas for a longer period of time. This helps
            them follow an argument from beginning to end and understand the connections between different points. By
            contrast, when they read short posts online, they often jump quickly from one topic to another, which makes
            it harder to think in a structured way.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This paragraph has a clear topic sentence, strong development, and a contrast that fits well in Cambridge essays.
      </p>

    <!-- 6. Practice -->
    <section id="u5-practice" class="unit-section practice-section">
      <h2>6. Practice</h2>

      <h3>Task 1 – Improve the topic sentence</h3>
      <p>Rewrite these weak topic sentences to make them more specific.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><em>There are many problems with homework.</em></li>
        <li><em>Technology has some disadvantages.</em></li>
        <li><em>Sport is important for young people.</em></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Task 2 – Add explanation and example</h3>
      <p>Complete the paragraph by adding explanation and an example.</p>

      <p><strong>Start:</strong> <em>One benefit of doing part-time work as a student is that it teaches responsibility.</em></p>

      <h3>Task 3 – Check unity</h3>
      <p>
        Write a short paragraph (5–7 sentences) about one advantage of social media. Then check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does every sentence support the topic sentence?</li>
        <li>Did you include clear explanation and at least one example?</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="u5-final" class="unit-section">
      <h2>7. Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Strong paragraphs are the skeleton of your essay. If your topic sentences are clear and every paragraph is
        well developed, examiners can quickly understand your ideas and give you credit for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next units, we will look more deeply at <strong>cohesion</strong> and <strong>coherence</strong> –
        how to link sentences and paragraphs so that your writing feels smooth and natural from beginning to end.
