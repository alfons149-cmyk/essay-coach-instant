    <h1>Refining the C2 Essay — Elegance, Depth, and Nuance</h1>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      You have reached the highest level of academic English writing. You can plan effectively,
      write fluently, evaluate critically, and edit with precision.
    </p>

    <p><strong>So what comes next?</strong></p>

    <p>
      Now it is time to refine — to write essays that not only meet the C2 criteria but
      <strong>feel alive</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this level, the difference between a Band 3 and a Band 5 essay is not grammar or vocabulary.  
      It is <strong>elegance, depth, and nuance</strong> — the quiet intelligence that runs through every line.
    </p>

    <p>
      This unit will show you how to add that polish and composure that distinguishes a strong essay
      from an exceptional one.

      <h2>1. Developing C2-Level Precision</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, small word choices make a big difference. Here are subtle but powerful vocabulary shifts:
      </p>

      <table class="table-2col">
        <tr><th>Basic</th><th>Advanced</th></tr>
        <tr><td>think</td><td>argue / maintain / contend</td></tr>
        <tr><td>show</td><td>illustrate / reveal / demonstrate</td></tr>
        <tr><td>say</td><td>claim / state / suggest</td></tr>
        <tr><td>bad</td><td>harmful / counterproductive / problematic</td></tr>
        <tr><td>people</td><td>individuals / society / the public</td></tr>
        <tr><td>problem</td><td>issue / challenge / dilemma</td></tr>
        <tr><td>good</td><td>beneficial / valuable / constructive</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Editing these choices into your essay gives it unmistakable C2 polish.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-precision-reflection">
      <h2>2. Final Reflection on Precision</h2>

      <p>
        Mastering the C2 essay means learning to think and write with quiet sophistication.
        It is not about longer sentences or more vocabulary — it is about
        <strong>precision, connection, and mature reasoning</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>At this level:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you do not just answer the question — you explore it,</li>
        <li>you do not just argue — you evaluate,</li>
        <li>you do not just write — you communicate thought.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-elegance">
      <h2>3. What Elegance Means in Writing</h2>

      <p>
        Elegance is not decoration — it is clarity with grace.  
        Every word feels necessary, and each sentence flows naturally into the next.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Elegance = Simplicity + Precision + Rhythm</strong></p>

      <p>Compare:</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌ Weak:</strong><br>
          In modern times, there is a wide range of diverse opinions concerning the multifaceted phenomenon of education.
        </p>

        <p><strong>✅ Elegant:</strong><br>
          Education inspires debate because it shapes both individuals and societies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>The second version says more with less — that is elegance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-depth">
      <h2>4. What Depth Means</h2>

      <p>
        Depth is not about using difficult words or writing more.  
        It is about seeing beyond the surface.
      </p>

      <p>You show depth when you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>question assumptions,</li>
        <li>acknowledge limitations,</li>
        <li>offer reasoning that feels human and intelligent.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Surface level:</strong><br>
          Technology has advantages and disadvantages.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Depth:</strong><br>
          Technology improves convenience but also changes how people define connection and attention —
          two aspects central to human life.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-nuance">
      <h2>5. What Nuance Means</h2>

      <p>
        Nuance is sensitivity. It prevents your essay from sounding absolute or mechanical.
      </p>

      <p>You express nuance when you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>accept partial truths,</li>
        <li>use cautious but confident language,</li>
        <li>recognise multiple perspectives.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          While success is often linked to ambition, it also depends on external factors such as opportunity and support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Nuance adds humanity to intelligence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-mindset">
      <h2>6. The C2 Writer’s Mindset</h2>

      <p>To write elegantly, think like an <strong>architect</strong>, not a bricklayer.</p>

      <p>Do not build your essay sentence by sentence — shape the whole piece.</p>

      <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the emotional rhythm of my essay?</li>
        <li>Where should it rise, pause, or resolve?</li>
        <li>Does the conclusion feel earned?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At this level, writing becomes composition, not just communication.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-sentence-elegance">
      <h2>7. Sentence Elegance: The Art of Flow</h2>

      <p>Elegant sentences feel effortless because each idea leads naturally to the next.</p>

      <h3>(a) Balance through Parallelism</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>Education not only prepares individuals for work, but also shapes how they think about the world.</p>
        <p>True progress depends on innovation, on courage, and on compassion.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Contrast for Energy</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>Technology connects us more than ever, yet many people feel increasingly alone.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(c) Reversal for Insight</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>People chase comfort, yet discomfort often teaches us the most.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(d) Sentence Expansion</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          Although technology simplifies many tasks, it also creates new expectations,
          often requiring individuals to do more in less time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>(e) Sentence Compression</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌ Long:</strong> The main reason why people choose to live in cities is because they have more job opportunities available.</p>
        <p><strong>✅ Short:</strong> Many people live in cities for better job opportunities.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-paragraph-elegance">
      <h2>8. Paragraph Elegance: Cohesion and Cadence</h2>

      <h3>(a) Echo Words</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>Risk encourages growth. Yet excessive risk becomes recklessness, which can prevent genuine progress.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>(b) Cadence</h3>
      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          Innovation demands risk. But without reflection, risk becomes noise.  
          True creativity requires both boldness and restraint.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-tone-shifts">
      <h2>9. The Power of Tone Shifts</h2>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Thoughtful:</strong> Many people believe that freedom guarantees happiness.</p>
        <p><strong>Analytical:</strong> However, freedom without purpose can also create uncertainty.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflective:</strong> Perhaps happiness depends less on freedom itself than on how wisely it is used.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Tone variation mirrors real thinking — it creates sophistication.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-metaphor">
      <h2>10. The Use of Metaphor (Gently)</h2>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>❌ Overdone:</strong><br>
          Education is the golden key that unlocks every door of the universe.
        </p>

        <p><strong>✅ Refined:</strong><br>
          Education acts as a bridge between curiosity and understanding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>A light metaphor, used sparingly, can elevate your writing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-register">
      <h2>11. Vocabulary: Choosing the Right Register</h2>

      <p>
        Refinement means choosing words that carry precision, not weight.  
        Avoid extremes: too plain or too ornamental.
      </p>

      <table class="table-2col">
        <tr><th>Simple</th><th>C2 Alternative</th></tr>

    </section>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-punctuation">
      <h2>12. The Music of Punctuation</h2>

      <p>Punctuation shapes rhythm and focus:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comma</strong> — soft pause</li>
        <li><strong>Semicolon</strong> — connects related ideas</li>
        <li><strong>Dash</strong> — dramatic pause</li>
        <li><strong>Colon</strong> — introduces explanation</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>Technology saves time; it also demands constant attention.</p>
        <p>Progress demands balance — not just ambition.</p>
        <p>Two qualities define good leadership: vision and empathy.</p>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-argumentation">
      <h2>13. The Subtle Art of Argumentation</h2>

      <p>C2 essays rarely argue in black and white. They reason in shades of grey.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>While this approach has clear benefits, it may not be universally effective.</p>
        <p>Although the argument is compelling, it overlooks the emotional aspect of the issue.</p>

    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-emotional">
      <h2>14. The Emotional Underlayer</h2>

      <p>
        Emotion in C2 writing appears through <strong>tone</strong>, not emotional words.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <p>
          Education should not be reduced to grades and numbers; it is the process by which we learn how to think.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>This is emotional depth without sentimentality.</p>

      <h2>16. Editing for Elegance</h2>

      <p>After finishing your C2 essay, perform a final elegance edit:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Read aloud — listen for rhythm.</li>
        <li>Check connectors — are they natural?</li>
        <li>Remove one unnecessary phrase per paragraph.</li>
        <li>Replace emotion with reasoning.</li>

      <h2>17. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        C2 writing is not about showing off — it is about <strong>revealing understanding</strong>.  
        It is the art of saying complex things simply, and simple things meaningfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        When your essay reads like thought made visible — logical, calm, and beautifully precise —
        you have achieved elegance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grammar makes you accurate.<br>
        Style makes you fluent.<br>
        Elegance makes you unforgettable.
