      You have reached the highest level of academic English writing. You can now plan effectively,
      write fluently, evaluate critically, and edit with precision.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      So what comes next? Now it is time to refine – to write essays that not only meet the C2
      criteria but <em>feel alive</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      At this level, the difference between a Band 3 and a Band 5 essay is rarely grammar or
      vocabulary. It is <strong>elegance, depth, and nuance</strong> – the quiet intelligence that
      runs through every line.

    <p class="unit-intro">
      This unit will show you how to add that extra polish and composure that distinguishes a

    <!-- 1. Elegance -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-elegance">
      <h2>1. What Elegance Means in Writing</h2>

      <p>
        Elegance is not decoration. It is clarity with grace. It is when every word feels necessary,
        and every sentence flows into the next with natural rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short:
        <strong>Elegance = Simplicity + Precision + Rhythm.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Elegant writing feels calm, logical, and beautifully balanced – not because it tries hard,
        but because it is built carefully.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example: Heavy vs Elegant</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>In modern times, there is a wide range of diverse opinions concerning the
          multifaceted phenomenon of education.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          ✅ <em>Education inspires debate because it shapes both individuals and societies.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        The second version says more with fewer words – that is elegance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Depth -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-depth">
      <h2>2. What Depth Means</h2>

      <p>
        Depth is not about writing longer or using difficult words. It is about
        <strong>awareness</strong> – showing that you can see beyond the surface of ideas.
      </p>

      <p>Depth means you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>question assumptions,</li>
        <li>acknowledge limitations,</li>
        <li>express reasoning that feels human and intelligent.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example: Surface vs Depth</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Surface level:</strong>
          <em>Technology has advantages and disadvantages.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <strong>Depth:</strong>
          <em>
            Technology improves convenience but also changes how people define connection and
            attention – two aspects central to human life.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Depth is when you make your reader <strong>think</strong>, not just nod.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Nuance -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-nuance">
      <h2>3. What Nuance Means</h2>

      <p>
        Nuance is sensitivity. It is what stops a C2 essay from sounding absolute or mechanical.
      </p>

      <p>You show nuance when you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>accept that ideas can be partly true,</li>
        <li>use cautious but confident language,</li>
        <li>see multiple angles in a topic.</li>
      </ul>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example of Nuance</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            While success is often linked to ambition, it also depends on external factors such as
            opportunity and support.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Nuance adds humanity to intelligence. At C2, that balance is essential.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Mindset -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-mindset">
      <h2>4. The C2 Writer’s Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        To write elegantly, you must think like an <strong>architect</strong>, not a
        <strong>bricklayer</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do not build your essay line by line – shape it as a whole. Ask yourself:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is the emotional rhythm of my essay?</li>
        <li>Where should it rise, pause, or resolve?</li>
        <li>Does the conclusion feel earned, not forced?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At this level, writing is not just communication. It is
        <strong>composition</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Sentence elegance -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-sentences">
      <h2>5. Sentence Elegance: The Art of Flow</h2>

      <p>
        Elegant writing feels effortless because each idea leads naturally to the next. Here are five
        stylistic techniques that bring elegance to your C2 essays.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Balance through Parallelism</h3>
      <p>
        Parallel structure creates rhythm and clarity.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Education not only prepares people for work, but also shapes how they think about the
          world.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>True progress depends on innovation, on courage, and on compassion.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>(b) Contrast for Energy</h3>
      <p>Contrast keeps your writing dynamic.</p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>Technology connects us more than ever, yet many people feel increasingly alone.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>(c) Reversal for Insight</h3>
      <p>Flip an assumption to sound thoughtful.</p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>People chase comfort, yet discomfort is often what teaches us most.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>Society values success, but failure defines resilience.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>(d) Sentence Expansion for Sophistication</h3>
      <p>
        Add secondary clauses carefully to show flexibility.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Although technology simplifies many tasks, it also creates new expectations, often
          requiring people to do more in less time.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One or two complex sentences per paragraph are enough. Balance them with shorter ones.
      </p>

      <h3>(e) Sentence Compression for Clarity</h3>
      <p>After a long sentence, ask: “Can I say this in fewer words?”</p>
      <p class="example">
        ❌ <em>
          The main reason why people often choose to live in cities is because they have more job
          opportunities available.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        ✅ <em>Many people live in cities for better job opportunities.</em>
      </p>

      <p>Clarity always wins.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Paragraph elegance -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-paragraphs">
      <h2>6. Paragraph Elegance: Cohesion and Cadence</h2>

      <p>
        At C2, your paragraphs should read like small essays – complete, balanced, and connected.
      </p>

      <h3>(a) Echo Words</h3>
      <p>Repeat one key term or synonym to create cohesion.</p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Risk encourages growth. Yet excessive risk becomes recklessness, which can prevent
          genuine progress.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h3>(b) Cadence (Rhythm of Thought)</h3>
      <p>Let each paragraph have a mini-climax – a turning point or insight.</p>
      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Innovation demands risk. But without reflection, risk becomes noise. True creativity
          requires both boldness and restraint.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>Cadence gives your writing emotional texture.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Tone shifts -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-tone">
      <h2>7. The Power of Tone Shifts</h2>

      <p>
        Changing tone – subtly – within your essay keeps it alive.
      </p>

      <p>For example, you might move from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opening tone:</strong> thoughtful – “Many people believe that freedom guarantees happiness.”</li>
        <li><strong>Middle tone:</strong> analytical – “However, freedom without purpose can also create uncertainty.”</li>
        <li><strong>Closing tone:</strong> reflective – “Perhaps happiness depends less on freedom itself than on how wisely it is used.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Tone variation creates sophistication. It mirrors real thinking.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Metaphor -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-metaphor">
      <h2>8. The Use of Metaphor (Gently)</h2>

      <p>
        At C2 level, a light metaphor can elevate your writing – but only when subtle and relevant.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ <em>Education is the golden key that unlocks every door of the universe.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          ✅ <em>Education acts as a bridge between curiosity and understanding.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>Simple, visual, and graceful. That is the kind of metaphor that works in an exam essay.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 9. Vocabulary -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-vocabulary">
      <h2>9. Vocabulary: Choosing the Right Register</h2>

      <p>
        Refinement means selecting words that carry precision, not weight. Avoid extremes – too
        plain or too ornamental.
      </p>

      <table class="structure-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Simple</th>
            <th>Natural C2 Alternative</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>use</td>
            <td>employ / apply</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>help</td>
            <td>support / facilitate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>show</td>
            <td>illustrate / demonstrate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>need</td>
            <td>require / be essential for</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>change</td>
            <td>transform / alter / affect</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>important</td>
            <td>essential / crucial / fundamental</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>problem</td>
            <td>challenge / dilemma / concern</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>people</td>
            <td>individuals / members of society</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Elegant vocabulary never draws attention to itself. It serves the sentence, not the writer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 10. Rhythm & punctuation -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-rhythm">
      <h2>10. The Music of Punctuation</h2>

      <p>
        At this level, punctuation becomes a stylistic tool. It shapes rhythm, emotion, and focus.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Comma</strong> – soft pause for flow<br>
          <em>Education, in many ways, defines opportunity.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Semicolon</strong> – connect related ideas<br>
          <em>Technology saves time; it also demands constant attention.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dash</strong> – dramatic pause or emphasis<br>
          <em>Progress demands balance – not just ambition.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Colon</strong> – introduce an idea or explanation<br>
          <em>Two qualities define good leadership: vision and empathy.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Using punctuation musically makes your writing sound confident and composed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 11. Argumentation -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-argumentation">
      <h2>11. The Subtle Art of Argumentation</h2>

      <p>
        C2 essays rarely argue in black and white. They reason in shades of grey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of <em>“This is right and that is wrong,”</em> write:
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        <em>While this approach has clear benefits, it may not be universally effective.</em>
      </p>

      <p>Or:</p>

      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Although the argument is compelling, it overlooks the emotional aspect of the issue.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        You do not need to resolve every debate. You just need to show that you understand it fully.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 12. Emotional underlayer -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u20-emotion">
      <h2>12. The Emotional Underlayer</h2>

      <p>
        Even in academic writing, emotion matters – not in big dramatic words, but in
        <strong>tone</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Readers feel authenticity when your sentences sound like they were written by someone who
        cares about clarity and truth.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        <em>
          Education should not be reduced to grades and numbers; it is the process by which we learn
          how to think.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        No emotional adjectives, yet emotional depth. At C2, that is mastery: feeling expressed
        through restraint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 13. Example essay -->

      <h2>13. C2 Example Essay (Refined Style)</h2>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            Summarise and evaluate the key points from both texts on the role of art in modern

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Model Answer</h3>

        <p class="example">
          <em>
            Both texts discuss the significance of art, though they approach it from different
            perspectives. The first sees art as a mirror reflecting social change, while the second
            emphasises its independence from politics and daily life.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            The first argument is persuasive, since art has historically driven awareness and reform.
            However, the claim that art’s only purpose is social seems too narrow. Artistic
            expression often goes beyond activism, capturing emotions that cannot be measured or
            legislated.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            The second text provides a refreshing reminder that art’s value lies partly in its
            freedom – the ability to exist for beauty rather than utility. Yet it underestimates how
            culture shapes artistic choices; even independent works are born within a social context.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          <em>
            Ultimately, art serves both roles: a mirror and a voice. It reflects society while
            reminding it what still matters – imagination, empathy, and the courage to see
            differently.

        A strong essay ends like a quiet exhale, not a trumpet blast. That quiet confidence stays
        with the reader.

      <h2>15. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        C2 writing is not about <em>showing off</em> knowledge – it is about
        <strong>revealing understanding</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is the art of saying complex things simply, and simple things meaningfully. When your
        essay reads like thought made visible – logical, calm, and beautifully precise – you have
        achieved elegance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Grammar makes you accurate.</li>
        <li>Style makes you fluent.</li>
        <li>Elegance makes you unforgettable.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">
        The examiner should finish your essay thinking:
        <em>“This person does not just write in English. They think in English.”</em>
      </p>

  <h2>12. Summary & Quick Reference</h2>

  <p>
    Unit 20 brought together every skill developed throughout the course — from sentence clarity (Unit 1)
    to C2-level evaluation (Unit 19).  
    This final summary focuses on the last layer of mastery: <strong>writing with elegance, depth, nuance, and rhythm</strong>.
  </p>

  <!-- ELEGANCE -->
  <h3>✔ Writing with Elegance (Clarity + Control)</h3>
  <p>Elegant writing is <strong>precise, economical, and confident</strong>. It avoids clutter and expresses ideas with clean movement.</p>

  <h4>Techniques for elegance:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer <strong>precise verbs</strong> over long phrases.</li>
    <li>Remove unnecessary qualifiers (<em>really, very, quite, extremely</em>).</li>
    <li>Avoid filler expressions (<em>in today’s modern world, due to the fact that…</em>).</li>
    <li>Cut repetition unless it adds rhetorical impact.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
    <p>It is very important to <u>really try to</u> reduce pollution because it is a problem.</p>

    <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
    <p>Reducing pollution is essential, as its impact is severe.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- DEPTH -->
  <h3>✔ Writing with Depth (Insight > Description)</h3>
  <p>Depth comes from showing that you understand <strong>why</strong> something matters — not just what it says.</p>

  <h4>Ways to add depth:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain <strong>causes</strong>, <strong>effects</strong>, or <strong>implications</strong>.</li>
    <li>Show <strong>tensions</strong> between ideas (e.g., efficiency vs. ethics).</li>
    <li>Reveal <strong>assumptions</strong> behind an argument.</li>
    <li>Mention the <strong>conditions</strong> under which an idea holds true.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Descriptive:</strong></p>
    <p>Text A believes technology improves education.</p>

    <p><strong>Deep:</strong></p>
    <p>
      While Text A claims technology enhances learning, its argument assumes equal access across schools —
      a condition that significantly limits the generalisation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- NUANCE -->
  <h3>✔ Writing with Nuance (Avoiding Absolutes)</h3>
  <p>C2 writing avoids oversimplifying arguments. It recognises <strong>complexity</strong>, <strong>conditions</strong>, 
     and <strong>degrees</strong>.</p>

  <h4>Nuanced language:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><em>to some extent</em></li>
    <li><em>in most cases</em> / <em>not always</em></li>
    <li><em>a more plausible explanation is…</em></li>
    <li><em>this depends on…</em></li>
    <li><em>a more balanced interpretation would suggest…</em></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Flat:</strong> Technology is harmful.</p>
    <p><strong>Nuanced:</strong> Technology can be harmful when used without regulation or oversight.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- RHYTHM -->
  <h3>✔ Rhythm & Flow (Sound Matters)</h3>
  <p>At C2, rhythm improves readability. Vary your sentence length and weight.</p>

  <h4>Balance short + long:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short sentences</strong> create impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Longer sentences</strong> build reasoning.</li>
    <li>Never let long sentences become heavy — structure them clearly.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Flat rhythm:</strong></p>
    <p>Many people think cities are stressful. They believe this because of traffic. They also believe this because of noise.</p>

    <p><strong>Fluid rhythm:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Many people consider cities stressful — the traffic, the noise, the pace.  
      Yet for others, this very intensity is what makes city life energising.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- VOCABULARY -->
  <h3>✔ Precision Vocabulary (No C2 “Overwriting”)</h3>
  <p>Good C2 vocabulary is not “complicated vocabulary.” It is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>accurate</strong></li>
    <li><strong>context-appropriate</strong></li>
    <li><strong>natural for academic writing</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Useful C2 academic choices:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><em>undermines</em>, <em>reinforces</em>, <em>clarifies</em>, <em>distorts</em></li>
    <li><em>assumption</em>, <em>implication</em>, <em>extent</em>, <em>consequence</em></li>
    <li><em>notably</em>, <em>significantly</em>, <em>marginally</em>, <em>arguably</em></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CHECKLIST -->
  <h3>✔ C2 Final Editing Checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Is every sentence necessary?</li>
    <li>Is my vocabulary precise rather than complicated?</li>
    <li>Is there depth in each argument?</li>
    <li>Did I avoid absolute generalisations?</li>
    <li>Is the rhythm varied and pleasant to read?</li>
    <li>Is my final position insightful and well justified?</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- PRACTICE -->
  <h3>✔ Try It Yourself</h3>
  <pre class="code-block">
Rewrite this paragraph to make it elegant, nuanced, and deep:

  Technology has a bad effect on young people because it distracts them.
  Many teenagers spend too much time online and this causes problems for society.
  It is always harmful when they use phones too much.

Targets:
  • Add nuance
  • Add depth (why it matters)
  • Improve rhythm
  • Use precise vocabulary
  • Remove absolute claims
  </pre>

  <p><em>This is the final layer of excellence: writing that is not only correct,
  not only analytical — but genuinely beautiful to read.</em></p>

      <p>
        And that is what this course ultimately gives: not just tools, but voice – the quiet,
        confident kind that lasts far beyond any exam.
