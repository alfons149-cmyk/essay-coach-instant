<h2>Unit 13: Understanding the C1 Essay Task</h2>

<p>
Moving from B2 to C1 is like upgrading from driving a small car to piloting a more powerful one.
The controls are similar – you still need direction, balance, and focus – but everything responds
faster.
</p>

<p>
At this level, examiners expect you not only to communicate clearly, but also to think and write
flexibly. In this unit, we’ll break down what the C1 essay looks like, how it differs from the B2
essay, and what examiners want to see from a high-level student. You’ll learn how to plan, write
and express ideas with precision, sophistication, and confidence.
</p>

<h3>1. What the C1 Essay Is</h3>

<p>
In the Cambridge C1 Advanced (CAE) exam, Part 1 of the Writing paper is always an essay. Just as at
B2, you must write a formal, discursive text. However, the task format is slightly different:
instead of three short notes, you are given <strong>two input texts</strong> – short opinions, comments or
extracts.
</p>

<p>
Your job is to read and understand both, then write an essay that discusses the ideas and gives
your own view.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example task:</strong></p>
  <p><em>
  In your English class, you have been talking about work and career. Your teacher has asked you
  to write an essay, using all the notes and giving reasons for your point of view.
  </em></p>

  <p><strong>Write an essay discussing the following statements:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>“People should enjoy their job, not just work for money.”</li>
    <li>“The most important thing is to have job security.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Write 220–260 words in an appropriate style.</em></p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>2. What Is Being Assessed?</h3>

<p>The C1 essay is marked using the same four criteria as at B2:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Content</strong> – Have you answered the task and used ideas from both texts?</li>
  <li><strong>Communicative Achievement</strong> – Is the style formal, appropriate, and consistent?</li>
  <li><strong>Organisation</strong> – Are ideas and paragraphs clearly organised and easy to follow?</li>
  <li><strong>Language</strong> – Do you use a good range of grammar and vocabulary with control?</li>
</ul>

<p>
At C1, examiners expect a more flexible, mature approach. They want to see that you can present
a balanced argument, evaluate ideas, and guide the reader logically from point to point.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>4. Reading and Analysing the Task</h3>

<p>
Before you write anything, spend around two minutes reading the task carefully. Your first goal is
to understand exactly what you must talk about.
</p>

<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the <strong>theme</strong>? (e.g. work and career)</li>
  <li>What are the <strong>two opinions</strong> or viewpoints?</li>
  <li>What does the question <strong>ask me to do</strong>? (compare, discuss both, give own view?)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you ignore one of the opinions, you lose marks for Content – even if your English is very good.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. A Reliable Paragraph Plan</h3>

<p>One simple but effective structure for the C1 essay is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 1 – Introduction</strong>: introduce the general topic + mention both opinions.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 2 – Opinion 1</strong>: explain, develop, and evaluate the first opinion.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 3 – Opinion 2</strong>: explain, develop, and evaluate the second opinion.</li>
  <li><strong>Paragraph 4 – Conclusion</strong>: give your own view and summarise the discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not the only possible structure, but it gives you a clear, safe framework to work within.
Once you are more confident, you can adjust it (for example, by combining evaluation more
explicitly or adding a short “bridge” paragraph), but you never need anything more complicated
than this.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Writing a Strong Introduction</h3>

<p>
At C1, your introduction should sound calm, balanced, and reasonably formal. Avoid very personal
openings like “In this essay I’m going to talk about…”.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example introduction:</strong></p>
  <p>
  Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions people make, and different individuals
  value different aspects of work. Some argue that enjoying one’s job is more important than the
  salary, while others believe that stability and security should come first. Both perspectives
  have valid points and deserve careful consideration.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
Notice that this introduction:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduces the topic in a neutral way,</li>
  <li>mentions both opinions,</li>
  <li>does not yet give a strong personal opinion.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>7. Developing a C1-Level Body Paragraph</h3>

<p>
Each body paragraph should take one of the opinions and explore it in some depth. A typical C1
paragraph:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>states the idea clearly,</li>
  <li>explains why some people hold this view,</li>
  <li>gives an example or consequence,</li>
  <li>offers a brief evaluation or limitation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example body paragraph (Opinion 1 – job satisfaction):</strong></p>
  <p>
  On the one hand, enjoying one’s job can make a significant difference to a person’s quality of
  life. People who feel motivated by their work are generally more productive and willing to
  improve their skills. For instance, someone who is passionate about teaching is likely to invest
  extra time preparing lessons. However, if this enthusiasm is not matched by a reasonable salary,
  it may become difficult to maintain in the long term.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>8. Comparing and Evaluating – Not Just Listing</h3>

<p>
A very common C1 problem is writing two separate paragraphs that simply describe each opinion,
without really comparing them. At this level, examiners want to see that you can weigh up ideas.
</p>

<p><strong>Try adding small “evaluation signals” like:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>However, this view does not take into account…</em></li>
  <li><em>On the other hand, it could be argued that…</em></li>
  <li><em>Although this is true in many cases, it is also important to recognise that…</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
These phrases help you sound more analytical and less mechanical.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>9. Writing an Effective Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Your conclusion should answer the question directly and show a balanced, thoughtful opinion.
Avoid simply repeating your introduction.
</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Example conclusion:</strong></p>
  <p>
  In my view, while job security is clearly important, it is difficult to remain satisfied in a role
  that offers no personal fulfilment. Ideally, people should look for work that combines both a
  stable income and a reasonable level of enjoyment, even if achieving this balance takes time.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>10. Register and Tone at C1</h3>

<p>Keep your language:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>formal but natural</strong> (no contractions, no slang),</li>
  <li><strong>precise</strong> (avoid very, really, a lot),</li>
  <li><strong>measured</strong> (no extreme emotional language).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instead of:</strong> “a lot of people think… it’s really important”  
<strong>Try:</strong> “many people believe… it is particularly important”
</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Summarising</td>
    <td>Overall, / On balance, / In summary,</td>
  </tr>

<hr>

<h3>12. Typical C1 Essay Mistakes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Only discussing one of the two opinions.</li>
  <li>Writing too personally (using lots of “I” and anecdotes).</li>
  <li>Using very long sentences that become difficult to follow.</li>
  <li>Trying to use advanced vocabulary without full control.</li>
  <li>Ignoring the word limit (writing far too little or far too much).</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this level, you do not prove your knowledge by being complicated; you prove it by being
precise. Examiners are looking for well-chosen words, not the most difficult ones.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>13. A Short Model C1 Essay (≈240 words)</h3>

<div class="example-box">
  <p><strong>Task:</strong> Discuss both opinions and give your view.</p>

  <p>
  Choosing a career is one of the most significant decisions people make, and opinions differ on
  what should be prioritised. Some argue that job satisfaction is more important than salary,
  while others believe that stability and security should come first.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the one hand, enjoying one’s work can greatly improve quality of life. People who feel
  motivated by their job tend to be more productive and more willing to develop their skills. For
  example, those who are genuinely interested in teaching or healthcare often invest considerable
  time and energy in helping others. However, if a job does not provide a reasonable income, it can
  eventually become a source of stress rather than fulfilment.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the other hand, job security offers a sense of safety that many people value highly. A stable
  position allows individuals to plan for the future and support their families. Nevertheless,
  remaining in a secure but unfulfilling job for many years may lead to frustration and a lack of
  motivation, which can also affect performance.
  </p>

  <p>
  In my view, neither enjoyment nor security alone is enough. While financial stability is
  essential, genuine job satisfaction is key to long-term happiness. Ideally, people should aim for
  a balance between both, even if this means making compromises at different stages of their
  career.
  </p>

<h3>14. Final Reflection</h3>

<p>
The C1 essay is not about writing more or using the most complex words you can think of. It is
about showing that you can understand different perspectives, organise your ideas logically, and
express them in clear, controlled English.
</p>

<p>
B2 shows clarity.  
<strong>C1 shows control.</strong>
</p>

<p>
You have already built strong writing habits in the previous units. Now the goal is refinement –
polishing your voice so that it sounds natural, thoughtful, and complete.
</p>

<p>
In the next unit, we will move on to
<strong>Unit 14: Planning and Developing C1 Essays</strong>, where you will learn how to build more
sophisticated outlines, link ideas across paragraphs, and plan balanced arguments that show the
maturity and flexibility examiners expect at this level.
