      Moving from B2 to C1 is like upgrading from driving a small car to piloting a more powerful one.
      The controls are similar – you still need direction, balance, and focus – but everything responds faster.

    <p class="unit-intro">
      At this level, examiners expect you not only to communicate clearly, but also to
      <strong>think and write flexibly</strong>. That means understanding the task, planning a clear structure,
      and then developing ideas with depth and balance.
    </p>

    <p class="unit-intro">
      In this unit, we will follow a simple four-step plan:

    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-what-is-c1-essay">
      <h2>1. What the C1 Essay Is</h2>

      <p>
        Before you can plan or write well, you need a clear picture of the task itself.
        In the <strong>Cambridge C1 Advanced (CAE)</strong> exam, <strong>Part 1</strong> of the Writing paper
        is always an <strong>essay</strong> – just like at B2. However, the input is different.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of three short notes, you are given <strong>two input texts</strong> such as short quotes,
        extracts, or opinions. You must read, understand, and use ideas from <strong>both</strong>.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example task</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          In your English class, you have been discussing the topic of work and career.<br>
          Below are some opinions from your classmates:
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          “People should enjoy their job, not just work for money.”<br>
          “The most important thing is to have job security.”
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Write an essay discussing both of these opinions and give your own view.<br>
          Write 220–260 words.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Everything else in this unit builds on this simple fact: you always work with
        <strong>two opinions + your view</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. What's being tested -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-assessment">
      <h2>2. What’s Being Tested</h2>

      <p>
        Once you know what the task looks like, the next step in our plan is to see
        <strong>how it is marked</strong>. The essay is assessed using four criteria from the Cambridge
        Assessment <strong>Writing Scale</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul class="breakdown-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Content</strong> – You include all parts of the task.<br>
          <span class="example">You discuss both opinions and give your own view.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communicative Achievement</strong> – You write in an appropriate, formal style.<br>
          <span class="example">No slang, no contractions, clear argument.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organisation</strong> – Your essay is logical and coherent.<br>
          <span class="example">Smooth transitions, clear paragraphs.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Language</strong> – You show range and control of grammar and vocabulary.<br>
          <span class="example">Complex sentences, advanced vocabulary, natural tone.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our unit plan follows the same logic: first understand the task, then build a structure,
        then refine language and organisation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Key difference B2 vs C1 -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-differences">
      <h2>3. The Key Difference Between B2 and C1</h2>

      <p>
        At <strong>B2</strong>, you show that you can organise your ideas and write clearly.
        At <strong>C1</strong>, you show that you can <strong>think</strong> – analyse, balance,
        and develop arguments with depth.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>B2 vs C1 focus</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Understanding</strong><br>
            B2: Follows instructions and covers notes.<br>
            C1: Synthesises ideas from two sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organisation</strong><br>
            B2: Logical, simple structure.<br>
            C1: Flexible but coherent argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Language</strong><br>
            B2: Mostly accurate, clear grammar.<br>
            C1: Range, control, and sophistication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tone</strong><br>
            B2: Formal and clear.<br>
            C1: Formal and mature, with natural flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Word count</strong><br>
            B2: 140–190 words.<br>
            C1: 220–260 words.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        This step in our plan tells you <em>why</em> the C1 essay feels different: it asks for
        <strong>evaluation</strong> and <strong>balance</strong>, not just description.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. How to read/analyse task -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-analyse-task">
      <h2>4. How to Read and Analyse the Task</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you know what the exam wants, the next step is to read the question in a structured way.
        Before you write, take two minutes to read the task carefully.
      </p>

      <p>You will always identify three elements:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>The topic</strong> (e.g. work and career).</li>
        <li><strong>Two opinions or extracts</strong> – each expressing a different view.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>The instruction</strong> – for example:
          <em>“Write an essay discussing both opinions and give your own view.”</em>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Analysing our example</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Topic:</strong> work and career</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opinions:</strong><br>
            1. “People should enjoy their job, not just work for money.”<br>
            2. “The most important thing is to have job security.”
          </li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> Discuss both opinions and give your own.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your essay must therefore include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a clear introduction to the topic,</li>
          <li>a discussion of <strong>both</strong> opinions, supported by examples,</li>
          <li>a final paragraph expressing your own view.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        Analysing the task in this way feeds directly into the next stage of our plan:
        building a clear structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Recommended structure -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-structure">
      <h2>5. The Recommended Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Although there are many possible essay structures, here is one clear overall plan that works
        perfectly for the C1 exam:
      </p>

      <table class="structure-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Part</th>
            <th>Job</th>
            <th>Approx. word count</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>1. Introduction</td>
            <td>Introduce the topic and mention both opinions.</td>
            <td>40–50 words</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2. Paragraph 1</td>
            <td>Discuss the first opinion and give your evaluation.</td>
            <td>60–70 words</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3. Paragraph 2</td>
            <td>Discuss the second opinion and give your evaluation.</td>
            <td>60–70 words</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4. Conclusion</td>
            <td>Present your own view and summarise logically.</td>
            <td>40–50 words</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        This is the “map” for your essay. The rest of the unit will show you how to
        <strong>fill each part of the map with clear, non-repetitive content</strong>.
      </p>

      <!-- PLANNING ANCHOR -->
      <article class="definition-card" id="u13-plan">
        <h3>Planning your C1 essay</h3>
        <p>
          Before you start writing, spend two or three minutes turning the task into this structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Note one key idea for <strong>opinion 1</strong>.</li>
          <li>Note one key idea for <strong>opinion 2</strong>.</li>
          <li>Decide your <strong>final view</strong> for the conclusion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A clear paragraph plan keeps your essay focused and stops you from repeating the same idea
          in different places.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Writing the introduction -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-introduction">
      <h2>6. Writing the Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Once the plan is clear, you can start filling the first part: the introduction.
        At C1 level, it should sound calm, natural, and thoughtful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid personal phrases like <em>I think</em> or <em>In my opinion</em> in the first paragraph.
        You can save them for the conclusion, where you give your final view.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example introduction</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          Choosing a career path is one of the most important decisions in life, and people’s priorities
          often differ. Some believe that job satisfaction should come first, while others argue that
          security and stability are more valuable. Both perspectives have merit and deserve consideration.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        This introduction follows the plan: it names the topic (career), mentions both opinions,
        and sets up the discussion without giving your final answer yet.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Developing body paragraphs -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-body-paragraphs">
      <h2>7. Developing the Body Paragraphs</h2>

      <p>
        The next step is to develop each opinion in its own paragraph. You do not just describe it –
        you <strong>evaluate</strong> it and show advantages and limits.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example (Paragraph 1: Enjoyment vs money)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          On the one hand, enjoying one’s job is essential for long-term motivation. People who feel
          passionate about their work are usually more productive and creative. However, this approach can
          be risky if the job market is unstable or salaries are low, as enthusiasm alone cannot pay the bills.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example (Paragraph 2: Job security)</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          On the other hand, having a secure job offers financial stability and peace of mind. A reliable income
          allows individuals to plan their future and support their families. Nevertheless, staying too long in
          an unfulfilling job can cause boredom and stress, which may eventually affect performance.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Each paragraph presents an idea, supports it, and then adds a balanced perspective.
        This is how you turn your plan into real content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Writing the conclusion -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-conclusion">
      <h2>8. Writing the Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        The conclusion is where your plan ends: you now give your opinion clearly, calmly, and logically.
        Avoid copying sentences from earlier paragraphs.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Example conclusion</h3>
        <p class="example"><em>
          In my view, while job security is important, genuine job satisfaction plays a greater role in

          personal fulfilment in their careers.
        </em></p>
      </article>

      <p>
        This conclusion fits the plan: it recognises both opinions and then gives a final,
        balanced answer to the question.

    </section>

    <!-- 9. Formal language and register -->
    <section class="unit-section" id="u13-register">
      <h2>9. Formal Language and Register</h2>

      <p>
        With the structure in place, the next stage is to polish your language.
        At C1 level, the register becomes even more critical. You must write formally, but with a natural rhythm.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Contractions: ❌ don’t, can’t, won’t</li>

          <li>Personal anecdotes: ❌ I once had a job…</li>
          <li>Emotional exaggeration: ❌ It’s totally amazing!</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Use instead</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is widely believed that…</li>

          <li>To some extent / On the whole / In conclusion…</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p>
        This step of the plan ensures that your well-structured essay also sounds mature and consistent.

      <p>
        While B2 essays use clear connectors (<em>firstly, on the other hand, in conclusion</em>),

        <p>
          At C1, many essays lose marks because they repeat the same argument with different words
          instead of developing it.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          ❌ Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 both say “job satisfaction is important” without adding new reasons.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
          When editing, ask: “Does this sentence add something new, or just repeat what I already said?”
          If it repeats, either cut it or deepen it. This keeps your overall plan strong and your paragraphs

        <h3>Ignoring the word limit</h3>

        Remember: clarity first, complexity second. You do not get higher marks for complex vocabulary –
        only for using it correctly and in line with your plan.

      <h2>12. The Balance Between Formal and Natural</h2>

      <p>
        Advanced writing does not mean robotic writing. You still want your essay to sound human and readable.
      </p>

      <article class="definition-card">
        <h3>Compare</h3>
        <p class="example">
          Too formal (overwritten):<br>
          <em>Individuals ought to pursue occupational satisfaction insofar as it contributes to their overall
          psychological well-being.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Natural, formal, clear:<br>
          <em>People should seek job satisfaction because it contributes to mental well-being.</em>
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        The second is simpler – and stronger. At C1, simplicity with control beats complexity without clarity.

          People often disagree about what makes a job worthwhile. Some believe that enjoyment should
          come first, while others argue that security and stability are more important.
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          On the one hand, job satisfaction is crucial for long-term success. People who enjoy what they do
          tend to perform better and feel more fulfilled. For example, those who work in creative fields often
          find meaning and motivation in their tasks, which increases their productivity. However, pursuing
          only passion can sometimes lead to financial difficulties or instability.
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          On the other hand, job security provides peace of mind and financial confidence. A reliable income
          allows individuals to plan their future and support their families. Nevertheless, staying too long in
          an unfulfilling job can cause boredom and stress, which may eventually affect performance.
        </em></p>
        <p class="example"><em>
          In my opinion, the best approach is balance. While financial stability is essential, genuine
          satisfaction gives life purpose. Ideally, people should seek careers that combine both enjoyment and
          security, even if this means making compromises along the way.

      <h2>14. Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        The C1 essay is not about writing longer or using bigger words. It is about thinking deeply,
        organising clearly, and expressing yourself with balance and confidence.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        B2 shows clarity.<br>
        C1 shows control.
      </p>

        At this level, you do not prove your knowledge by complexity – you prove it by
        <strong>precision</strong>. You have already built strong writing habits in the previous units.
        Now, the goal is refinement – polishing your voice into one that sounds natural, thoughtful,
        and complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next unit, we will move to <strong>Unit 14: Planning and Developing C1 Essays</strong>,
        where you will learn how to build sophisticated essay outlines, link ideas across paragraphs,
        and plan balanced arguments that demonstrate the maturity and flexibility required for the
        Cambridge C1 Advanced exam.
