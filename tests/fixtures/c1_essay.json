  "studentText": "The rapid expansion of online learning has led many people to suggest that physical classrooms may soon become unnecessary. On the positive side, digital courses offer remarkable flexibility: learners can study around work or family commitments and revisit recorded explanations when concepts remain unclear. Furthermore, the internet provides immediate access to a wide range of resources, from lectures by leading researchers to discussion boards where international students exchange ideas. Despite these strengths, online learning still faces significant limitations. Motivation and persistence are harder to sustain at home, where distractions are plentiful and peer pressure is minimal. In addition, subtle classroom cues—like a confused expression or a hesitant pause—help teachers adapt pacing, something that video platforms rarely capture well. Perhaps most importantly, education is more than content transmission. It also involves socialisation, confidence-building and negotiation, which develop naturally through group projects and face-to-face debate. For these reasons, online learning should be seen as a powerful complement rather than a full replacement for traditional education.",
